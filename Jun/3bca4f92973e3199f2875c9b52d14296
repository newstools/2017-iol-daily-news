Warrant Officer Ndabenhle Duncan Zwane, 44, came under fire when he and his team were spotted by the gang that was apparently expected to blow up an ATM at a centre in Unit6 in Hammarsdale. Zwane was based at the National Intelligence Unit. Brigadier Jay Naicker, provincial police spokesperson, said officers received information about the planned hit. The officers made their way to an area nearby and were spotted by the would-be robbers. The men fired at police, who shot back. The bodies of two robbers was found a short distance from where the shoot-out began. One of the getaway cars which they had hired, a white Renault Clio, was traced to a homestead in Mophela, where five of the gang members had driven to. Two of the men were shot inside the house, one on a bed and the other on a small brown couch, while two more were shot inside the car and a fifth outside the car. Neighbours near the homestead said they were shocked by the incident. It is alleged the man who lived at the homestead was paroled in 2015 for committing a similar offence. His family declined to comment and only said the man was in his early forties and worked as a vendor in the Durban CBD. Naicker said police recovered two rifles, four handguns, five explosive devices, two detonators, a gas mask, a pari of goggles, gloves and two cars. Meanwhile, Mxolisi Kaunda, the MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, has condemned the killing of the police officer. “It is regrettable that the officer lost his life in this incident. “Regarding the death of suspects, we have warned time and again that police have a right to defend themselves when they come under fire from criminals,” he said. He also extended his condolences to the officer’s family. Daily News
