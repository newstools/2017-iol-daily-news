DURBAN - With the Vodacom Durban July just hours away, a Durban-based traditional healer consulted the bones to see who will win South Africa's biggest horse race. The healer, Baba Malinga, alongside Hloniphani Nzama (who he trained), joined forces to ask the ancestors to reveal the winner.The consultation, which cost R400, took at least 30 minutes to be completed.Malinga began by burning incense, before asking the ancestors to show him the way. With the bones already in the bag, he shook the bag, took the bag, took the bones out and held them in his hands. (Nzama) poured some water onto the bones and threw the bones onto a grass mat. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Durban traditional healer reveals the horse that will win the Vodacom Durban July on Saturday.Both Malinga and Nzama threw the bones at least eight times, before announcing the number of the horse.After the eight time, Malinga and Nzama announced that number 4 (Brazuca) will be the horse that will win the Durban July.
