Durban - Two people were injured when protestors threw a petrol bomb into the truck they were travelling in  at uMgeni Road, just after the N2 interchange on Wednesday morning. They were treated by minor burns by paramedics and taken to hospital. This, after protests flared up in Clare Estate in the early hours of the morning. Scores of irate residents from informal settlements along the M19, in the vicinity of Makro, took to the roads to burn tyres and refuse, blocking traffic off at the uMgeni interchange. The lower end of Burnwood Road was lined with piles of refuse. Sydenham police rushed to disperse the crowd and open part of the roadway, allowing peak traffic to continue smoothly. In Burnwood Road, officers managed to clear one lane of the busy road to let cars through. Smaller pockets of burning dirt could still be seen at the side of the road. Police said the reason for this morning’s protest was not yet known. This follows yesterday’s unrest in the same area. Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security, said groups of people gathered along the road to burn debris. Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesman, said the reason behind Tuesday’s protest was yet to be determined. It is suspected that the protests could be linked to ongoing issues of poor service delivery. Daily News
