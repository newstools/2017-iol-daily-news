Here, he was expected to reveal what his take is on the Gupta email saga, among others. Malema maintained on Wednesday that he was not involved or was mentioned in the emails. "South Africans can no longer wait. These emails are proof that those who run the government today have betrayed their country," he said after he claimed that the lawyers are using delay tactics. He added that the betrayal was handing over constitutional decision making powers to the Gupta family.    He also tackled gender-based violence against women and children and condemned it. "Treating women as though they are property and sexual objects for men has been at the centre of this violence." He dubbed South Africa as a "patriarchal society in which toxic masculinity and violence against women is celebrated". Malema suggested the solution to this was the education of feminist values. The EFF leader then touched on the topic of the storm in Cape Town and the fire in Knysna that has killed eight and left thousands displaced. Malema stated that it served as a reminder that land needs to be restored to the poor after expressing condolences. After discussing the price of locomotives, he expressed that cases will be opened against Malusi Gigaba, Trillian, Regiments and Salim Essa "The Minister of Finance is a corrupt fellow with a corrupt family, in-laws, brothers, wife. All of them are corrupt!" He then drew his attention to President Jacob Zuma. "We must arrest Zuma to teach those after him that they must not do such," he said. IOL
