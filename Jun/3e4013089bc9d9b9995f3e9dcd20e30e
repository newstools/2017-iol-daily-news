Cape Town – Roofs were blown off houses in parts of Cape Town, trees uprooted, roads forced to close and electricity to various areas cut off as the monster storm coming in off the Atlantic coast hit the Mother City overnight. The City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre reported that two people – a woman and a four-year-old child – were injured when powerful winds ripped the roof off their home in Lavender Hill. The child was taken to Victoria hospital.

Roofs were also blown off in the Strand area, Kalkfontein, Delft, Mfuleni, Mandalay, while 15 people were displaced when their roofs were blown off in Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay. Charlotte Powell, spokesperson for the Disaster Risk Management Centre, said: “At this stage we can report that 15 people are displaced in Imizamo Yethu due to their dwellings/roofs blown away. Five people are staying at a school in Maitland as their dwelling was compromised. (Royal Road informal settlement).”

The City also reported trees uprooted in Durbanville, Delft, Plattekloof and Plumstead, where a tree landed on a block of flats but luckily no one was injured.
