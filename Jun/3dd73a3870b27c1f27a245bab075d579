DURBAN – Suspects made their way into a Durban mall and store, and fled with clothing and valuables on Youth Day. This after weeks and weeks of reports on mall robberies in KwaZulu-Natal.   According to a report from Blue Security, security guards contacted the security company after a mall on Durban’s Commercial Road was robbed.  When Blue Security arrived at the scene of the crime, they found that the front door of the mall had been smashed open.
