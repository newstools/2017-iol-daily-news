CAPE TOWN - Cricket South Africa boss Haroon Lorgat announced on Tuesday that there will be no transformation 
targets for the T20 Global League. And I have to agree with that. Squads will include five 
international players, one marquee Protea and two rookies and once the starting line-up requirements are filled, the coach could only have space for four local players. How can you possibly then still worry about how many black players there are in the squad? With a quota system in place, you also run the risk of losing more mense to overseas contracts because now a lot players will be fighting for possibly two spots in the team. Lorgat told Sport24: “In terms of transformation, the league won’t be target specific, but the whole philosophy of transformation is in the prospectus and we have asked all the team owners to be very mindful of that. “In the seventh year, there will be a review based on key performance indicators and we reserve the right to cancel the agreement with an owner if they don’t meet those, and transformation is part of that.” Of course in terms of the development of young talent and transformation, the T20 Global League will do very little or basically nothing, but the main target of this tournament is money and fun for the fans. The money on offer could even bring guys such as Kyle Abbott back to Mzansi, but he is not going to stay beyond the tournament and it’s not like the new league will keep players in the country. They will only play for their respective teams for just over a month once a year. One player, though, who is looking to use the tournament for good is marquee Protea player JP Duminy, who is looking to incorporate his J21 development programme into the Cape Town Knight Rider’s programme. He says: “It is important to give back, bring youngsters from underprivileged areas to the stadium and for us to go to them.”    Daily Voice   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
