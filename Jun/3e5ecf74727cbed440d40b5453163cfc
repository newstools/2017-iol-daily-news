DURBAN - A shop keeper was shot dead by three bandits on Monday morning as he opened his store on Main Road in Doonside, Amanzimtoti. He was shot after apparently resisting an hold-up by three armed men who burst into his shop and demanded cash shortly before 7am. When paramedics arrived on scene, local authorities were already in attendance. Paramedics found the man, believed to be in his late twenties, lying motionless inside the store. "After being assessed by ER24 paramedics, they found that the man had sustained a fatal gunshot wound to his chest and showed no signs of life," ER24 spokesman, Russel Meiring said. "Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene," he said.  It is believed that the man was approached by the gunmen while he was walking into the store and opening up for the day. It is not yet clear whether anything was taken from the store, but Amanzimtoti SAPS are investigating charges of murder and business robbery. Daily News
