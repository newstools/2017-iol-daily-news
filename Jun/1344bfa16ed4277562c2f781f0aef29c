PARLIAMENT: Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane could be headed for a legal showdown with the SA Reserve Bank over her report recommending the bank s mandate be changed. Mkhwebane s report has put her on a collision course with Sarb, Absa and Parliament - all said they would take it on review. Sarb governor Lesetja Kganyago launched his application this week but Mkhwebane said yesterday she could defend her decision in court. She said she would make up her mind soon on whether to oppose it or not. But the fight is already on, with Parliament and Absa to launch their own court applications soon.Mkhwebane s spokesperson Cleo Mosana said they would make the decision in due course. They were meeting lawyers, and would decide whether to oppose the application or not.Mkhwebane has been in the firing line since she released the report on Sarb s bailout of Bankorp during the apartheid era. The CIEX report has been at the centre of the public protector s decision to ask Parliament to clip Sarb s wings.The Sarb said in its annual report and court application its mandate was to protect the currency and price stability.The public protector had no authority to change that, Kganyago said in court papers, and cannot be allowed to interfere with its independence, powers and functions.Daily News
