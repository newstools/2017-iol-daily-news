They are moving closer! The KZN Sharks Board has reported that sardines have been netted at Winklespruit, Amanzimtoti and Isipingo beaches on Thursday morning.&nbsp; &quot;A total of eight nets have been landed and net sizes have varied from small to medium with the largest net producing 300 crates. The netters are selling the fish at R900 a crate with each crate holding between 28 to 30 dozen sardines depending on the size of the fish. Netting could possibly continue in these areas this afternoon,&quot; said Mike Anderson-Reade, Head of Operations at the KZN Sharks Board. Observations from the flight this morning revealed scattered pockets of sardine between Isipingo and Umgababa. These pockets are accompanied by a small number of Cape gannets. Apart from a number of Cape gannets seen off the Pennington and Sezela areas, no further sardine activity was noted on the southern KZN coast.There is a strong south westerly wind forecast for this evening, hopefully the rougher conditions will not move the fish offshore again. Shark safety gear has been removed between and including Scottburgh and Anstey s Beach on the Bluff. All the other shark safety gear along the coast remains in place and beaches are open for bathing. This may change as the run develops and more gear may be removed over the coming days depending on the status of the sardine shoals. Daily News
