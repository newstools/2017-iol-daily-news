Durban - The ANC preceded its much-talked about policy conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg on Thursday night with a gala dinner with some of the country's top movers and shakers. Guests, which included captains of industry and other high profile guests were treated to a gourmet dinner. But it was the wine that was served that set tongues wagging.As some within the ranks of the ANC rail against White Monopoly Capital, those attending the gala dinner could not help but notice that wine being served was from the vineyards of&nbsp;Rupert &amp; Rothschild - the epitome of what some might say is White Monopoly Capital.&nbsp;According to their website, the Rupert &amp; Rothschild partnership was formed in 1997 by the late Dr Anton Rupert of South Africa and the late Baron Edmond de Rothschild of France.&nbsp;&quot;Their vision and guiding principles were carried forward by their sons, the late Anthonij Rupert and Baron Benjamin de Rothschild. Today the Rupert family and Baron Benjamin de Rothschild share this prestigious partnership in wine production,&quot; the website says.Twitter had a field day pointing out the hypocrisy&nbsp;on Thursday night.
