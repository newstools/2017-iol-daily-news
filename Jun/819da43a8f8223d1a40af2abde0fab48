She shared her story of how she conquered cancer and continued to live a positive life. Naidoo, a nurse, was speaking at the launch of Cuppa for Cansa on Wednesday. She was diagnosed in 2003. “Listening to my doctor say my greatest nightmare had become reality, left me breathless. I felt the sting of death at my door,” she said. At the time of her diagnosis, Naidoo said it made no sense because she was a health freak who went to gym daily. Her life, that had seemed so young and fresh, suddenly became dark and hopeless. “In that moment, a new me emerged. I became a fighter who was not ready to die. I was ready to put on my boxing gloves and take on my biggest opponent, the Big C. And my husband bought me a set of boxing gloves and they were signed. They reminded me that I was not alone,” she said. Naidoo underwent a mastectomy and an aggressive regime of chemotherapy. She said she relied on the strength and comfort of friends and family. Naidoo shares her experience with women to encourage them to get tested. She was named the International Hero of Hope for Cansa and the American Cancer Society. The launch of Cuppa for Cansa will see many events planned from now until October, with all proceeds going to the association. More information on how to register and to host your event can be found on the Cansa website. Daily News
