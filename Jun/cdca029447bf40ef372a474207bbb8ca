DURBAN – #SocialMediaBlackout turned out to be a joke when South Africans spent most of their time on Twitter, trying to find out who was staying away from social media, which defeated the purpose of the blackout.   Wednesday 21 June 2017 was officially marked as #SocialMediaBlackout day because of South Africa’s ridiculously high data prices.  South African poet, musician and beadwork artist, Ntsiki Mazwai called on the population of South Africa to participate in a social media blackout. At the same time, Twitter went crazy as #DataMustFall was trending by the end of the day.  However, come Wednesday morning and the movement was pointless. For starters, how could #SocialMediaBlackout be the number one trend in South Africa if people are staying off social media?  We all struggle with high data prices and for people to just stay away for one day, seemed like asking for too much.
