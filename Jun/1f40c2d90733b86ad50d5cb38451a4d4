 The insurance company on Sunday posted a video on Twitter in honour of all the "amazing dads out there". In the video, fathers are seen sharing happy moments with their children and having silly moments.  Instead of stirring emotions, the advert caused an outrage, with users blasting it for its lack of diversity and failing to represent South African fathers of all races.   Happy #FathersDay to all the amazing dads out there! pic.twitter.com/pibcerM52W  — OUTsurance (@OUTsurance) June 18, 2017   One user sarcastically congratulated the company for turning what should have been a celebration of all fathers, into a celebration of white fathers.  This doesn't accurately represent FATHERS of all races in South Africa.

Celebrities also reacted to the video, with the likes of actress Rami Chuene posting a montage of pictures which could have been used to celebrate fathers.   Actor Hlomla Dandala also weighed in on the matter, saying the advert clearly demonstrated how fatherhood was clearly not a black thing.    When contacted for comment, Outsurance said it was aware of the post and has since apologised for the "offensive" advert. Some of the reactions to the advert:         OMW! Anyone else recently seen @OUTsurance's Life Insurance ad – the one where the dad dies? I'm shocked at the insensitivity of it! Shocked  — Eulogi (@Eulogs) June 17, 2017      IOL
