DURBAN - The rugby career of Sharks and Springbok flyhalf Patrick Lambie hangs in the balance after the revelation on Monday that the 26-year-old will not play rugby again this year because of an on-going concussion issue. On Monday, Sharks CEO Gary Teichmann said that while medical advice continues to determine the future of the 56-Test Bok, a break from the game for the rest of this year would be in the best interests of the player. “We are in the hands of the medical experts but it seems unlikely that Pat will play for the Sharks (and Springboks) again this year,” the CEO said. “It is very sad that our captain cannot play but the matter is with the experts in this field (concussion), and it looks like Pat must take a long rest from rugby. "It goes without saying that Pat is being monitored by the leading physicians in this field. We can only hope that he will fully recover after a long break, and we leave the matter in the hands of the professionals.” The unlucky Lambie has been struggling with injury problems over the years, including a bicep tear, injury to neck vertebrae, a heavy concussion after a collision with Ireland flank CJ Stander this time last year, a heavy knock suffered when he was struck accidentally by a Waratahs player and then there was another heavy collision with one of his own team-mates in a freak accident in a Super Rugby match against the Kings. The courageous Lambie has not announced his retirement from rugby but we know that he will not play again this year. The Mercury  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
