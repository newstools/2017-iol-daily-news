For those who plan on attending and are still unsure on how to dress for the theme,  Shoesmith said this year’s theme is open to lot of personal interpretation,  through choosing colours that evoke emotions. “There’s freedom to play with different colours such as burgundy, gold, copper and green.”  She has suggested that attendees need not to be afraid to cover up,  by using layers such as  capes and stylish coats to complement an  outfit , as we are in the middle of winter and chilly weather is always expected.  Shoesmith also mentioned that people must remember it's not an evening event but daytime and classic elegance is key.
