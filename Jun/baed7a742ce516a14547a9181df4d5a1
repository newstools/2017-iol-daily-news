DURBAN – The hammer gang smashed their way into yet another jewellery shop in Old Main Road in Hillcrest.  According to Blue Security media and community liaison officer, Andreas Mathios, a gang of three robbers entered a shopping mall on Old Main Road on Sunday night and reportedly used a hammer to smash open the door of a jewellery shop.  “The gang fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of jewellery in a white Toyota Corolla with no registration plates,” Mathios said.  Mathios also said that it was unclear whether the incident is linked to the many mall robberies across the city in recent weeks.  Reports do not suggest that any jewellery was taken from the shop, however, Hillcrest police were at the scene of the crime and are investigating the incident.  In recent weeks, the hammer gang had robbed malls and centres throughout KwaZulu-Natal, targeting jewellery shops and shops which have a lot of cellphones. Daily News
