Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Steel said a new design had been decided on and they had submitted their building plans to the municipality. “Once the plans are approved, the tender process will begin and we believe that work will begin in October this year,” Steel said. He explained that the new building structure would be considerably smaller than the previous dome, as it would seat 3000 people and not 5 000, as the building did before.

Last year, fire teams battled to douse the blaze at the iconic building. Fortunately, only the roof of building was damaged while the actual building structure remained intact. The fire was caused by an electrical fault. Steel said the new structure was expected to cost around R70 million. “One of the things we have been able to recover is the stage. “We spent a lot of money on a stage for the old building. Someone had donated that to us, so miraculously we will not have to spend on rebuilding that,” he said. Services are currently being held in a tent on what used to be one of the church’s parking areas. Earlier this month, the church hosted a celebration service called Out of the Ashes inside the dome structure. Steel said it was emotional to be inside the actual structure and, despite the cooler weather that evening, there was a large turn out. Daily News
