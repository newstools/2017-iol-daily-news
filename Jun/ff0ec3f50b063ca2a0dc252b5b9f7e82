Boipatong – EFF leader Julius Malema says the struggle facing the youth of today was obtaining economic emancipation. Malema said what set the youth of 1976 apart from their parents, was their fearlessness to confront oppression during apartheid. “The youth of 1976 refused to believe that white people were meant to rule over us”, said Malema followed by loud cheers from the crowd.   He was addressing thousands of EFF supporters at the party’s Youth Day commemoration event in Boipatong in Vaal, on Friday.  Malema said the youth of today should stand up and fight for their own emancipation.  Boipatong’s roads are filled with rocks and rubble, evidence of a recent service delivery protest in the area.  He encouraged supporters to protest against the ANC when the party does not provide them with the services they need.    “The people of Boipatong, Sedibeng and the whole of Gauteng are angry with the ANC. The EFF is ready to govern Gauteng,” he said.  Malema spent a large part of his speech addressing the issue of education and encouraged young people to be innovative in order to create jobs.  He said they should stop demanding mall development in the townships and instead create business opportunities.  “If you want a mall, don’t vote for the EFF. The EFF will not build you malls but will build factories,” said Malema.  He said if the youth could create business opportunities then the DA-led City of Johannesburg and Tshwane would help the with financial support by force as the EFF had supported them with votes to take over the metros.
