Nadelin Lukas from Boezak Street in Scottsdene, was rushed to hospital where he later died of the fatal stab wound to his neck. Jessica Shelver of the Western Cape Education Department says the incident happened at Scottsdene High School on Tuesday. “The alleged perpetrator is in Grade 10. Both boys are aged 15." “The school believes that the incident is gang-related. The alleged assailant accompanied a teacher to the police station,” said Shelver. The pupils were lining up for a meal from the school’s soup kitchen at 9:45am and a fight broke out between two boys. A witness says Nadelin hit a boy with a stick, and the boy defended himself. “Nadelin was the first one to hit the guy who killed him. He hit him with a stick,” she says. “He was looking for a knife to stab him and that boy just defended himself." “It was so terrible. I have never been so scared." “Everybody ran and screamed and I was just five steps from them and saw the other boy pull out his knife to protect himself and he stabbed Nadelin in the neck.” The victim was rushed to the Kraaifontein Day Hospital and died soon after. Dad Deon Visagie, 48, says he will miss his son very much.  “His mother and I are not married and weirdly Tuesday morning I struggled to get him out of bed." “I went to work and left him still sleeping,” he says. “When I got the call about his death, I knew something was wrong before I answered the phone." "I don’t know if my son belonged to a gang, but I taught him to always watch his back." “The tears just come when I think of losing my son. His entire life was ahead of him.” Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirms a 15-year-old boy has been arrested. “A case of murder is being investigated,” she said. Daily Voice
