Police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha, said the man was sentenced on Monday by the Willowvale Regional Court and that the sentence was welcomed by the Eastern Cape police as it was line with their priority that crimes against women and children be given high priority in the province. "It is alleged that the accused, who cannot be identified as he is the elder brother to the victim, aged 17, visited his sister (victim) on August 23, 2016 at Qwaqwa location, Mfula Village, Willowvale," Manatha said. "The victim was not staying at home with the accused as she was renting a room next to the school where she was studying. The accused pretended as if he was visiting his younger sister to find out if she was fine." Manatha said the 17-year-old told the accused at about 11pm on the night in question that she was going to sleep as she was going to school the following day. "The accused threatened to stab the victim with a knife and pushed her to bed. He then raped her and left." Manatha said the 25-year-old pleaded not guilty and claimed that he was drunk on the night in question. "On August 24, 2016, the 17-year-old victim, upon learning that a crime against her has been committed, reported her ordeal to police." The matter was then investigated by the Butterworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS). African News Agency
