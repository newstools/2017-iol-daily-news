As turmoil gripped our country, many South African children escaped for an hour or two to the movies – whether it was at the bioscope or on a projector. So we went around the office to find out what our favourite movies were when we were kids. Please note that some of us are older than others so this list spans many generations. Karate Kid 1 and 2 (the originals) – Yes, I am THAT old. Wax on, wax off. And don't forget that song: Peter Cetera: "I am the man who will fight for your honour." – Lou-Anne Dirty Dancing - Because "Nobody puts baby in a corner". I recall my dad taking us to the drive-in at Goodwood Showgrounds to see it. - Liesl Casablanca – This is my all-time favourite movie from my childhood: my dad introduced it to me. Most memorable quotes, best wordplay, and Bogey at his absolute best. "Of all the gin joints in all the world, she had to walk into mine." – Lance Police Academy 1 - 5 - The humour was bad and naughty but we laughed ... hard. "When you’re Bubba Smith, you can get away with doing this to cars." This was my favourite . It's from Police Academy 4. The driving lesson scene. - Liesl The Last Dragon – Cheesy but it was the 80s. Leroy and Vanity.  "Who's da mastah?" "Sho'nuff!" - Riana "Aladdin" and "The Spice Girls" - Aladdin was the first Disney movie I can properly recalling watching and it was just this wonderful movie that made you want for the good guy to succeed and become this prince after being a street kid. "The Spice Girls" because I loved their music, and the movie was the culmination of everything about the group I loved. I recently watched it, and it was despicably bad, but I still enjoyed every minute of being because it was a big indicator to something that I should have realised sooner. - Theo But June 16 is a day to watch Sarafina, because who can forget the song, "Freedom is coming tomorrow."
