Durban Ezlin Hannah Naidoo s smile beamed down from the overhead projection screen as mourners gathered on Wednesday to bid farewell to the little girl who was mauled to death by a dog.Dressed in a colourful Eastern outfit, the photograph of Ezlin on the funeral programme brought tears to the many mourners who packed St Peter s Anglican Church in Newlands East.Ezlin died after the dog turned on her outside her grandmother s Mayville residence on Saturday afternoon. The little girl had been dropped off at her grandmother s house earlier in the day with her 6-year-old brother, Tyler, as their parents were both working. It is unclear what transpired, but one of four dogs attacked little Tyler. When Ezlin came towards the dog, it released Tyler, who managed to run away. The dog then attacked Ezlin, who fell to the ground. Neighbours tried in vain to pull the dog off. At the funeral, Ezlin was described as a little queen by a relative who thanked the many who have supported the family in their grief. Several members of the Metro Police and South African Police Services attended the funeral to support Ezlin s father, Shaylin, who is also a police officer. Relatives wept as Ezlin s white coffin was escorted out of the church. The hearse and family car were led by two Metro Police vehicles with SAPS officers on motorcycles riding behind a car procession. The toddler was laid to rest at the Clairwood Hindu Cemetery after the funeral service.Meanwhile, the dog that attacked the little girl has been put down by the SPCA.Speaking to the Daily News, Lindsey Concer, SPCA Durban and Coast Marketing Manager, said the owner of the dogs had signed a document known as an owner s request which meant the dogs have been signed over with a request to humanely euthanise all four animals. This included a male adult cross breed, female adult pit bull and two cross breed puppies. The male adult cross breed was the dog that attacked the children. Daily News
