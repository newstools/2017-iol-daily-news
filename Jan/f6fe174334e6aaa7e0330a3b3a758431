A friend of mine had entered and he told Mr Schoeman that I also play guitar. Mr Schoeman entered me and I took part in the provincial rounds as a musical soloist. I participated in the competition in December and played Hotel California as my rock piece and Autumn Leaves as my jazz piece for the competition, he said. Jhevarn, who is in Grade 11, has been playing the guitar for nine years, and plays lead and bass guitar, with lead being his firm favourite of the two. The talented teen hails from a family of musicians. My grandfather, father and mother all play instruments. My grandfather plays classical music and my father also plays guitar. My mother is involved in praise and worship in church, he said.He said he was very excited to hear that he had been selected for the competition.Jhevarn s achievement earned him provincial colours for music. He will be playing the Guns N Roses classic, Sweet Child of Mine, in the competition.Daily News
