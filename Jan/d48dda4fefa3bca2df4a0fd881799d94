Durban The modern-day trend of young women entering into relationships with much older men for money is a growing social problem which has captured the attention of a budding film-maker.Simphiwe Dlezi, 24, has put his hand in his own pocket to write and direct a short film that seeks to warn &nbsp;youngster about the dangers of engaging in relationships with so-called blessers . From what I see happening around us as young people, I see the blesser trend as one of the things slowly killing our youth. A social media account named bless-finder surfaced last year where women who hoped to find a blesser were asked to leave their pictures and contact details which attracted much attention. The film warns girls and women not to date old, married men as it comes with consequences which may destroy their lives. These old men use them and then run away, he said.Dlezi saved money to shoot the documentary while working part-time in his community. The film, Uthando Lwam (My love) was shot in Port Shepstone on the South coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where Dlezi was born.The film is about 10 people from the South Coast who have dedicated their time to passing on the message to the community and through social media and by other means, that the blesser trend is a dangerous one. Dlezi said they had pushed the film on social networks and at schools to source what little money they could to enable them to buy proper studio equipment. We put short clips of the film on social media platforms for people to watch. We also approached schools for permission to let the pupils watch the movie as it is educational to them since they are the targets, he said.Dlezi said he hoped to start on the second part of the film but lacked capital as he was unemployed. Dlezi said the term blesser is so commonly used that some women do not see any shame in it.Daily News
