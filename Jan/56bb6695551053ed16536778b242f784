Durban He had been happily washing his car and the next thing he was dead, said a neighbour of Joseph Monauna, 48, who died when he crashed a bicycle into a wall. Sunday s incident has left his family and neighbours in Isipingo s Lotus Park traumatised. Althash Govender, Monauna s neighbour, said he called out to Monauna, whom they fondly knew as Joe, to join him for his birthday celebrations from the driveway they shared in Sunbird Crescent. They chatted while Monauna washed his car. We were sharing a few jokes and then he took my son s mountain bike for a ride in the car park. I think he went to buy a headache tablet from the shop down the road. He was riding alongside his son, Govender said.
