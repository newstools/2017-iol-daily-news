Durban The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal is pushing for an early provincial conference &quot;to avoid speaking in different languages&quot; at the ANC s policy conference in June.The youth league wants to have its elective provincial conference as early as next month, instead of June.The two-year term of the ANCYL in KZN was supposed to end in June, but seven regions have written to their provincial leaders asking for the early provincial conference because 2017 was a busy year, with the national policy conference in June and the national conference in December.ANCYL KZN spokesperson Mandla Shange said the three-day provincial conference would begin on February 24.The ANC eThekwini region is among the regions that had approached the province.ANCYL eThekwini regional spokesperson Thulisa Ndlela said holding the conference next month would allow those who will not be elected time to heal , so that the province will be reunited ahead of the ANC conferences. We cannot stand to have congresses that are going to divide us because congresses are divisive by nature, as there is someone to be elected and someone to be defeated.&quot; Therefore, we took a decision to bring the provincial conference forward so that people can find enough time to heal and work together ahead of the national congress.&quot;Ndlela said the ANCYL in Mpumalanga had held its congress last year, and it was now focused on preparing for the national conferences.It is believed that most of the league s regions in the province were lobbying for provincial deputy chairperson Kwazi Mshengu to succeed current chairperson Thami Ngubane, and retain Thanduxolo Sabelo as the provincial secretary. Other positions would be determined by the branches at the provincial conference, Ndlela said.Daily News
