“It’s critically important that there should be the necessary security measures at key installations in the justice and security cluster. This is non-negotiable,” said Francois Beukman, speaking following the overnight break-in at the Gauteng North directorate for public prosecutions in Pretoria. “I think the recent break-ins indicate that there are indeed certain lacunas (gaps) in the application of security measures. There should be the necessary steps taken by accounting officers to step up security, so there’s confidence from the public that confidential information will be held securely.” The burglary came less than a week after the headquarters of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), more popularly known as the Hawks, was broken into. Financial information, ­supply chain management and human resources files were stolen during this break-in. Beukman says the acting head of the Hawks, Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata, would be called before the ­committee on August 4 for a full briefing and report-back on the burglary. “With relation to the DPCI, it’s a huge concern for the portfolio committee because the DPCI is tasked with investigating serious and organised crime. There should be extraordinary measures in place to ensure there couldn’t be break-ins or any attempts to obtain information illegally,” said Beukman. “We also want an assurance that countrywide there are efforts to ensure DPCI offices are properly secured to ensure there won’t be a repeat of what happened last week.” The two latest burglaries follow similar break-ins at the office of the Chief Justice, where computers containing the employment information of judges and other staff were stolen. The alleged mastermind behind the burglary was arrested in March and released on R5000 bail. Nkosinathi Msimango claimed he had no knowledge of the break-in. Beukman said the nature of the break-ins pointed to serious security breaches. ANA
