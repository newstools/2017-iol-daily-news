PUBLIC Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has agreed to investigate disgraced former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, for the R30 million "golden handshake" he received was awarded by the beleaguered power utility. Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Natasha Mazzone on Monday said her party requested the investigation after it emerged that the Eskom board approved a the payout to Molefe after only 18 months as CEO of Eskom. "It is unacceptable that an individuals such as Brian Molefe, who sits deeply in the pockets of the Guptas, is rewarded not for doing a good job for the people of our country, but is paid millions for serving the interests of one family," said Mazzone. She said the DA made the request following public outrage over the “golden handshake” which later became a “performance bonus”, and then a “pension payout". "This outrageous payout is a gross abuse of public funds, especially after Molefe resigned 'in the interests of good corporate governance' after his close ties to the Guptas were revealed in the damning State of Capture report," said Mazzone. "Molefe does not deserve the R30 million. In fact, he does not deserve a single cent. He must pay back every dime of the R30 million to Eskom." The DA said Eskom is in deep financial trouble and the money could go a long way in bringing much-needed stability at the power utility. Mazzone said the DA will continue to fight to root out the deeply entrenched corruption at Eskom. "South Africans deserve public servants who work to improve their lives, not individuals who are only interested in lining their own pockets." African News Agency (ANA)
