Durban - A three-year-old girl has died after she was burnt beyond recognition in a shack fire in Verulam north of Durban on Thursday morning. Private security company Reaction Unit South Africa spokesman Prem Balram said a shack that had been built next to a newly built home, in a scheme of low-cost housing, caught alight. Balram said the charred body of the child was found among the debris. Balram said the girl was asleep in the shack when her aunt decided to go into the main building to have a bath. "Members of the public who were walking past the home noticed the shack engulfed in flames and attempted to extinguish the blaze with buckets of water. It could not be established if the fire was caused by a burning candle or a faulty electrical connection which was supplied from the main building," Balram said. An inquest docket was opened at Verulam police station. The incident follows the death of two children, aged 8 and 4, in Inanda on Monday when their home caught alight. Allegations are that a two plate stove could have set off the fire. Daily News
