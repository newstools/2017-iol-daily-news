It is alleged than an elderly 
white man entered the store around 11am and, while doing his shopping, attacked a female black member of staff. The man, estimated to be in his late 70s, allegedly screamed that post-1994 black staff thought they owned the place. Professor Rozena Maart was in the store at the time and tried to intervene when the man turned around and threatened her. Maart, who is on sabbatical, is the Director for the Centre of Critical Research on Race and Identity. She said the man was elbowing and screaming at a woman. “He claimed that she had walked into him. He had a walking stick in one hand and a set of keys in the other, switching it as he used his fingers to point it at her, millimetres away from her face." Maart said the staff member was preparing her cash float so it was impossible for her to have walked into him. The man, shouting at the top of his voice, shoved his finger in her face and proceeded to tell her that she must look where she was going, she said. Maart said she was shocked. When she intervened, the man screamed back at her. “He told me it was not my business and I told him that he was rude and out of order. I continued, making sure that I stepped closer to him so he would know that I would not back down." “He began shouting that I was doing this to him because he was white,” she said. Daily News
