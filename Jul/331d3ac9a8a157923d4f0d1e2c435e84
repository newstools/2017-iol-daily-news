DURBAN - The body of a newborn baby was recovered in a pit latrine in Shaka’s Head outside Ballito on Thursday morning. IPSS Medical Rescue assisted Police K9 Search and Rescue with the recovery. “It was a newborn, it was still attached to the placenta,” said Paul Herbst, IPSS Rapid Care Medic. Herbst said rescuers could not tell the sex of the newborn. “I won’t be able to say. I couldn’t tell. We just put the newborn in a body bag,” said Herbst. There has been an increase of babies being dumped in KwaZulu-Natal. Asked how many new born babies had been found dumped by IPSS since the start of the year, Herbst said between 12 and 15. He said most of the babies were found dead, with a smaller percentage found alive. Daily News
