DURBAN – The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) on Friday announced it had set up a special task team to probe the shooting of three African National Congress (ANC) councillors of the uMzimkhulu municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. The three councillors, PR councillor Sindiso Magaqa, ward 11 councillor Nonsikelelo Mafa ,and ward 16 councillor Jabu Mzizi, were shot outside a general dealer in the Ibisi area on Thursday evening. "The victims sustained multiple gunshot wounds and they were taken to hospital for medical attention. The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrest has been made at this stage," Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement. "We urge anyone with information regarding the attack to contact their nearest police station." Magaqa was the ANC Youth League secretary general under then leader Julius Malema before the league was disbanded in 2012. Shortly after the shooting, ANC KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli, said: "They were parked outside a general dealer when a red BMW came, people got out and opened fire on them and drove off." The shootings follow the killing of three other councillors in the area this year. African News Agency (ANA)
