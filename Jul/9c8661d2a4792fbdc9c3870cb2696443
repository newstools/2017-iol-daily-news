Welabasha Technical High School is now occupied by about 1400 pupils from Empangeni, Richards Bay, Esikhawini and Mtubatuba. There are also 43 teachers and other support staff including security guards, cleaners and clerks. The facility is part of the group of schools which has been earmarked by the provincial government for upgrades and renovations, to convert them into technical high schools with boarding facilities. The IDT, an entity of the national Department of Public Works, also had to renovate 15 old classrooms, a science laboratory and ablution facilities. The project, including the new facilities and renovations, cost R105 million. Seventeen new classrooms were built, as well as two multipurpose centres, two computer laboratories, three workshops for electrical, civil and mechanical engineering, a hospitality block with a kitchen, and an administration block. New sports facilities were also added, as well as a media centre, toilets, parking, a high-capacity water tank and a sewage treatment plant. About 200 people worked on the project. “They all came from the surrounding areas, and the IDT is proud to have used the project to help reduce the high levels of poverty in the area,” said spokesperson Lesego Mashigo. “For all this to happen, the IDT had to do extensive community mobilisation and negotiations with the local chief, who donated the land for the new school, as well as the local communities who also vacated their fields for the school to be built.” Daily News
