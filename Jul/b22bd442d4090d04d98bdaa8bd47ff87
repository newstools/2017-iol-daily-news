DURBAN - The week has started on a bad note for commuters travelling by plane around South Africa because fog has caused major delays for people leaving and arriving at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. Commuters using airlines such as South African Airways (SAA), Kulula and Mango took to social media to vent their frustrations at the fog that has caused delays to their flights. Flights have not been able to land at OR Tambo since early Monday morning. Instead they have been diverted to airports such as Lanseria, where the flights refuel and wait for conditions to clear. SAA said the decision to divert flights was based on safety. “Due to poor visibility caused by fog at OR Tambo International Airport, some of our flights to Johannesburg have been diverted to other domestic airports. At this stage only two international flights from Sao Paulo and Hong Kong were diverted to Durban. In addition, two domestic flights were diverted to Lanseria and Bloemfontein,” said Tlali Tlali, SAA spokesperson. Leigh Gunkel-Keuler, spokesperson of OR Tambo International Airport, said they had to redirect flights to airports such as King Shaka International Airport due to deteriorating weather conditions. “Earlier, 24 flights were diverted but flights are now going back to schedule as conditions have improved,” said Gunkel-Keuler. “The good news is that the weather improved during the morning and flights have begun to land and depart from the airport.” “Given the earlier diversions, we will be challenged with managing flight backlogs throughout the course of the day in order to accommodate those flights which were diverted,” she said.
