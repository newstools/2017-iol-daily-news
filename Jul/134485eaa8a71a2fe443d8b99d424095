Acting chairperson of the portfolio committee on public enterprises Zukiswa Rantho said on Wednesday they had more questions for Eskom. She said in the past few months since the committee agreed to call Duduzane Zuma, President Jacob Zumaâ€™s son, and the Guptas, they had received more information on Eskom. However, Rantho would not go into details on the information. She said they would start with the inquiry into the power utility next month. No dates were set yet for the inquiry, because they were still sifting through a mountain of information. Rantho confirmed Duduzane Zuma and the Guptas would be called to give evidence. The investigation into Eskom is part of several probes by committees in Parliament, but the public enterprises committee was the first to initiate an investigation into state capture. It was followed by other portfolio committees on transport, energy and home affairs. This was part of the decision by House chairperson Cedric Frolick that these committees investigate state capture. Opposition parties failed in their attempt to get an ad hoc committee to conduct a single comprehensive inquiry into state capture. Zuma had also questioned multiple investigations into state capture, saying a commission of inquiry would be better suited to conduct the probe. He said he would appoint the commission as soon as possible. The ANC endorsed the inquiry during its policy conference in Nasrec, Joburg. Recently leaked e-mails have revealed more information on state capture, widening calls for Zuma to go and a full-scale probe and prosecution of those implicated. Last week, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said he did not support a court action by civil society organisations for him to appoint a commission of inquiry into state capture. He said such authority lay with the president, as directed by the constitution. Daily News
