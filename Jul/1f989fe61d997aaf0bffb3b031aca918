PARLIAMENT's Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation on Monday conveyed condolences to the families of the two football fans, who died in a stampede at the FNB Stadium. Two people died and 19 others were injured - one of them critically, when fans tried to force their way into the stadium to watch the Carling Cup between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates on Saturday. The match in 90,000-seater stadium, which had been sold out, continued to the end and was won by Chiefs. Chairperson Beauty Dlulane said the committee wished those who were injured a "speedy recovery". “The accidents of this nature are avoidable and should not be happening as South Africa is experienced in games of that magnitude. When spectators come to stadiums there should be plans in place that guarantee their safety,” said Dlulane. “Furthermore the Premier Soccer League is experienced in hosting big matches and events. Security plans and crowd control measures should not be compromised. All the matches between the Soweto Giants are crowd pullers and planning for such matches should be done accordingly.” Dlulane said families of the deceased should be assisted wherever possible with funeral arrangements and the injured should be provided with medical care. "The committee appreciates the ministerial task team minister, Thulas Nxesi, announced on Sunday and believes it will hopefully identify gaps in the stadium security that might have led to the accident."
