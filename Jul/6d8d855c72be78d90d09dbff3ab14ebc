According to Nick Dollman of Netcare 911, two cars had been involved in a high-speed collision where five people, including both drivers, died at the scene. A 15-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy had sustained severe injuries. A devastated Philisiwe Ntuli said her mom, sister and aunt died in the crash. Her younger brother was in a critical condition in an intensive care unit and she said things were not looking good for him. Ntuli said her mother, Nocelo, sister Lungile and aunt Matozi were returning from visiting a sick relative in Ndwedwe when the crash took place. “I was shocked when I was told early the next morning. I had been trying to call them to find out about their whereabouts,” she said. Ntuli said the pain she was feeling was indescribable as they were the only family she had. “It was very hard losing my mom as she played the role of a mother and a father in my life. “She kept us together as a family unit after my father died in 2010.” Recalling the last conversation they had, Ntuli said: “We were discussing on Saturday how we were finally able to move on as a family after my dad died in 2010. “But then this tragedy happened.” She also missed her sister Lungile, who used to help her with providing for her family. Her younger brother, Akwande, remains in a critical condition in hospital. Her neighbours in Newtown had been very supportive as her relatives were not nearby to provide emotional support. Ntuli said the funerals were planned for tomorrow. The crash was one in a bloody weekend on the province’s roads when more than 10 people died. The events led to Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda calling for the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy which had recently been approved by the cabinet, and more visible policing on the province’s roads.
