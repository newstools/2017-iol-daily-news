DURBAN - The younger sister of Chatsworth woman Desiree Murugan who was beheaded and her head sold to a traditional healer broke down on the witness stand during the mitigation of sentence at the Durban High Court on Tuesday. She was describing the family's anguish of having to bury the decapitated remains of their loved one two weeks after she was stabbed 192 times. 
Her body was found at Shallcross Sports Field without the head in 2014. The deceased distraught sister Jennet Murugan told the court that they could not bury her for two weeks as the police searched for her head. She said the family was stuck with a headless body for weeks. The discovery of Murugan's dissected head was found buried at the home of traditional healer Sibonakaliso Mbili's homestead in Mfume. She said the funeral was different from other funerals as her sister's coffin came sealed and family was not allowed to open it because of the state of the remains. "We were told that the remains of the dissected head were placed in plastic bags next to the body inside the coffin," she said wiping away the tears. She said her mother's health had deteriorated since her sister's death and could not come to court. Friends Thuso Thelejani, Mlungisi Ndlovu, Mbali Magwaba and traditional healer Mbili are expected to be sentenced this week for her murder. During the trial, Falakhe Khumalo who turned state witness and is serving a life sentence had testified that Mbili had promised to pay R2million for the head of an Indian, colored or white woman.
