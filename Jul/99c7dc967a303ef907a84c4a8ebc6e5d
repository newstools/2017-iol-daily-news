The passenger was severely entrapped and whilst Advanced Life Support Paramedics stabilised the man inside the cab the Durban Fire Department used the Jaws of Life and other Hydraulic equipment to try free the man. The Durban Fire Department utilised a Heavy duty Tow Truck to lift the rear of the truck and then they could free the man.” “With the truck landing on top of the bakkie, he is severely entrapped by his lower limbs,” Jamieson explained. The bakkie was pinned underneath the truck. It took nearly two hours after the crash, to free the passenger. Traffic on the N2 Northbound had been at a standstill during this time. The exact cause of the collision was unknown, said Jamieson, but police are currently investigating. Daily News
