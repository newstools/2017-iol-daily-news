Sri Lanka and Ceylon tea, together with their diplomatic organisations across the globe, marked the historic milestone by hosting parties in about 50 countries. The tea party started in the Pacific and ended on the west coast of the Americas. Starting at 5pm and held in every time zone, the global party was celebrated in a chain for 24 hours around the world. Local guests, including members of the diplomatic corps, gathered at the Durban Chamber of Commerce conference centre for a cup or two of the famous Ceylon tea. It is marketed as the first and only “ozone friendly” certified tea in the world, recognised by connoisseurs as being among the best speciality teas in the world. Sunil De Silva, the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to South Africa, flew to Durban from Pretoria for the tea party. He told guests that the “Fifth Rose” in the popular South African tea brand Five Roses denoted Ceylon tea. Daily News
