It is alleged that Randeree’s mother-in-law was followed home by armed men, in a silver-grey BMW. As the elderly woman drove into the yard, the men stopped behind her and got out of their car. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Randeree was outside when he heard the commotion inside the house. “As he entered, he tried to intervene and was shot. The men fled and no arrests have been made,” said Zwane. Police are investigating a case of murder and house robbery. Randeree was shot in the abdomen and was taken to hospital, where he died. Minutes before the Sherwood shooting, the same car was seen in Westville and believed to have been linked to an incident in the area. When contacted for comment, the Randeree family declined to speak, asking for the media to respect its privacy. Meanwhile, tributes have been pouring in for the family on social media. Saturday’s shooting follows a shoot-out in Clare Estate where Sydenham police officers came under fire from a gang of men. Officers were patrolling along O’Flaherty Road when they saw three men running out of a driveway. A source said the officers were flagged down by a resident who said a house robbery had just occurred. “Officers gave chase and the suspects ran on to a construction site and fired at police. With help from the SAPS airwing, flying squad and K9 unit, officers arrested two suspects and recovered a Z88 pistol and live rounds,” the source said. The two men are expected to appear in court soon. Daily News
