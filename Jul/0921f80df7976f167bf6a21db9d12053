DURBAN - The parents of pupils from Assegai Primary School in Wentworth, Durban took their protest to the Department of Education circuit offices in Umbilo on Wednesday morning. The parents, who protested outside the school on Monday morning against the appointment of a new principal, chanted “we are not racist” and demanded a meeting with the department officials. But they were prohibited from entering the department’s offices on Acton Road. The parents are angry that the department appointed a high school teacher as the new principal instead of Odette Rita Abrahams, who had been the acting principal for the past two years. The school’s last principal resigned in 2015 after 25 years of service. Kwazi Mthethwa of the Education Department said people were employed based on their qualifications and experience. The parents were concerned that the new principal had a Level 1 qualification and only seven years’ experience, and would be unable to manage the school. However, Abrahams has a Level M7 qualification, which is equal to an honours degree. Mthethwa said, “If the parents are unhappy with the new principal, then they should lodge a formal dispute and put it through the proper channels.” Daily News
