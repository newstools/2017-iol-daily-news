DURBAN - The eThekwini Municipality’s Metro Police removed scores of vagrants who had invaded the Berea Station Railway Line on Tuesday. According to the city, the operation, conducted in partnership with South African Police Services and other law enforcement agencies was to enforce the city's by-laws and rid the area of crime and grime. In a statement, the city said the Metro Police prioritises high "crime and grime" areas including decaying central city areas where petty crime and vagrancy is prevalent. More than 30 vagrants who had taken occupation of the railway line were removed.  The area was then cleared of all objects that posed a danger to trains and commuters. Metro Police Spokesperson, Sibonelo Mchunu, said that the raid was part of the officers’ ongoing law enforcement operations.  “We are committed to ensure that the city remains clean, safe and conducive for all citizens to enjoy.  Living next to the railway line poses serious danger for both the vagrants, infrastructure and train commuters.  That is why we had to act fast and remove the vagrants from the site.” Mchunu said that they would monitor the area and prevent any future invasion. The law enforcement operations, which begin in the early hours of the day and continue throughout the day, are in response to calls by residents for more Metro Police presence and by-law enforcements. These include noise complaints, complaints about vagrants loitering and sleeping outside places of business as well as people urinating in public. The enforcements were intensified following the implementation of the Nuisances and Behaviour in Public Places By-law last year. Daily News
