Durban – Nine months after joining East Coast Radio and promising to move all of his business to Durban, Phat Joe is leaving the station and the city. Phat Joe, whose real name is Majota Khambule, and ECR mutually agreed that his contract as the host of the afternoon drive show would not be renewed. He had only been at the station for a year. Nine months ago, the deputy mayor of eThekwini, Fawzia Peer, had given Phat Joe a framed certificate of welcome after the DJ had officially moved to the city.
 
“Your journey was fantastic. We thank you for assisting the municipality with social and socio-economic challenges, and fund-raising projects. We are also very grateful to East Coast Radio,” Peer said.
 
Phat Joe joined the radio station in August 2016 and although he brought lots of laughs to ECR and Durban, he also brought with him, his infamous controversy.
 
On his first day at ECR, Phat Joe pranked listeners by announcing his resignation, threw a tantrum and smashed his welcome cake. In August, Phat Joe mentioned tattooing a baby and also made jokes about rape in jail. 
 
In September, the president of the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s SRC “took it personally” when Phat Joe called students at the university “the worst people in the world”.
 
In February, Phat Joe made a comment about “feeling Down syndromish”, on his show, much to the anger of parents of Down Syndrome children. East Coast Radio reportedly forked out R30 000 after a ruling by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) over the comments. However, Phat Joe did do some good. When it was alleged that baby Siwaphiwe was abducted, an anonymous caller on ECR offered R10 000, which was matched by Phat Joe. Daily News
