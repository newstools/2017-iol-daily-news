DURBAN - Just days after burying their son, the Randeree family has been left reeling following a hijacking at their Sydenham home on Tuesday night. Fashion World boss Hassim Randeree was on his way home from visiting the family of his dead son, Mohamed ‘Langers’ Randeree, when he was hijacked near his residence in Canon Avenue. Mohamed Randeree was shot during a robbery on Saturday and died in hospital shortly thereafter. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, Mohamed was outside when armed men stormed the home. “When he heard the commotion inside, he went in to see what was going on and was shot. The men fled the scene and no arrests have been made,” he said. Police had initially opened a charge of attempted murder and house robbery. The attempted murder charge was changed to murder when Mohamed died. The killers remain at large. It is alleged that the elder Randeree was followed home last night and approached by armed men near his home. A source said that balaclava-clad men demanded he alight from his Mercedes-Benz. They then drove off in the car. The car was traced to Lindelani, where police were involved in a shootout with the hijackers. The Mercedes-Benz was recovered, along with the suspected getaway cars used by the men. Zwane said Sydenham police are investigating a case of hijacking. No arrests have been made. Daily News
