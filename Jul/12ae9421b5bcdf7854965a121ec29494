CRIME activist Yusuf Ambrajee is considering to lay a complaint against the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) for their racially exclusionary bursaries, which exclude white and Indian South Africans from applying for the organisation’s Thuthuka bursary scheme. Speaking to Independent Media on Friday, Abramjee said it was an “insult” to Indian South Africans to be excluded from the bursary as they had also been previously disadvantaged under the apartheid government, like coloured and black African South Africans, to whom the bursary solely caters for. Abramjee had been alerted of the issue by an Indian father whose son was turned down because they were Indian. “I had a complaint from a member of the Indian community whose son was turned down because they were Indian. Eventually I posted on Twitter to find out why Indian South Africans were excluded because they are also previously disadvantaged,” he said.  In its response to Abramjee, SAICA said the bursary was for Africans and coloured students only, because white and Indian South Africans “surpass their representation in the CA (chartered accounting) profession”. “Whites and Indians surpass their representation in the CA profession.  Whereas Africans and Coloureds were lagging seriously and generationally behind. It was this alarming result that prompted SAICA to make a conserted effort and targeted approach to increasing Africans and Coloureds numbers to be reflective of the EAP demographics through the formation of the Thuthuka Bursary Fund,” the organisation said. Spokesperson Karin Iten said she could not respond as she was yet to consult with leadership in the organisation when asked about Abramjee’s ploy to lodge a complaint with the human rights commission. Abramjee said the bursary was “discriminatory and unconstitutional”. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
