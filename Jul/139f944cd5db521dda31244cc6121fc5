The DA would continue to fight for Zuma to have his day in court. No amnesty deal should be granted to the man who - with the help of his party - sold South Africa to the highest bidders, said DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe. While the legal battle to hold Zuma accountable on 783 charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering against him had been ongoing for close to a decade, it was still far from over. “Zuma has been abusing the court system to delay his inevitable date with the law. He will not succeed,” Selfe said. He said the ANC had used every opportunity to shield Zuma from accountability and that the latest proposed “political settlement” was hardly surprising. “It was symptomatic of a party that has completely lost its way and was too far gone to ever self-correct. “We have filed answering affidavits to Zuma's appeal against the high court's ruling that the NPA’s (National Prosecuting Authority) decision to drop the 700 charges against him was irrational and we will appear again in court on September 15,” Selfe said. “It is outrageous that the ANC is considering amnesty for its leader because they have completely failed to hold him and those politically connected to him accountable for running this country into the ground. “This latest amnesty move proves that the ANC has been complicit in undermining the constitution and condoning the abuse of power. Such amnesty will set the precedent that powerful politicians deserve special treatment and will violate a sacred constitutional principle, namely, that all citizens are equal before the law. “The ANC cannot be allowed to continue abusing our democratic institutions to protect one man,” Selfe pointed out.
