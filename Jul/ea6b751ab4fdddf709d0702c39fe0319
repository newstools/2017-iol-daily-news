DURBAN - Three people were left injured on Wednesday morning on the N3 before Pavilion Mall. Just after 5am, two trucks and a car collided, and left three people injured. When Rescue Care Paramedics arrived at the scene of the accident, they found that three of the four lanes were blocked by the accident. Traffic was backed up as only one lane was working and others opted for using the Westville route to avoid the traffic. Ceron Lennox of Rescue Care said that is is alleged that a truck had broken down and assistance was on scene when another truck collided into them. “Three patients had sustained various injuries and were stabilised on the scene before being transported to various Durban hospitals for the further care that they required,” he said. SAPS were on scene and will be investigating the incident further. In another incident, early on Wednesday morning, three vehicles collided in Ridley Park Road in Malvern, which left a few people injured. Daily News
