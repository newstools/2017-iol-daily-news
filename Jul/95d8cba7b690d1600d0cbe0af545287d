This comes after contractors at Transnet in Richards Bay Port staged a bizarre protest in May, using bulldozers to damage infrastructure and overturn police vehicles. At least 13 contract workers were arrested and charged with malicious damage to property. At the time, Transnet Port Terminals said the protest was the result of an illegal strike by contract workers employed by materials handling company Radds at their facility in the Port of Richards Bay. Numsa’s Richards Bay local secretary, Charles Mohlala, said on Thursday that contractors were “fed up” with being treated like animals and the majority of them did not experience dignity and equality. Mohlala said the union expected at least 1500 contract workers to join the march, as all affiliates of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) would be represented, including secretary-general Zwelinzima Vavi, adding that their march would be peaceful and they had obtained permission to hold it. He said some of their grievances included an alleged sex-for-jobs scandal, corruption, equal pay for equal work, health and safety in the workplace, as well as the banning of labour brokers. Transnet spokesperson Molatwane Likhethe was not available to comment at the time of publication. Mohlala also accused Transnet of pay discrimination, saying that contractors and permanent staff fulfilled the same work for the same amount of hours, but the permanent staff were earning more than the contractors, and receiving transportation subsidies and other basic benefits. “We want a ban on labour brokers. Some contractors have been on contract with Transnet for as long as 20 years.” ANA
