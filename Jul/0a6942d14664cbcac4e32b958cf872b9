Although David Mabunda announced this week that he and the board had agreed to part ways at the end of the month, the KZN Ministry of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs has “categorically” stated that MEC Sihle Zikalala, as the representative of the provincial government, had not endorsed the agreement to release him. “He is not out,” said Bongani Tembe, the department’s spokesperson. He explained that while the MEC had received the submission where the chief executive and the board proposed Mabunda’s departure, “the MEC is still applying his mind on the submission and he is engaging with all the parties”. The MEC said: “Foremost in our minds is to ensure that Ezemvelo’s capacity to deliver on its mandate is maintained, and, as such, whatever decision we reach on this matter will be informed by what will be in the best interests of Ezemvelo.” In the meantime, Mabunda “remains the chief executive of the entity and we would like to assure the people of KZN and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife stakeholders that the entity is stable and is currently seized with executing its mandate”. Musa Mntambo, the Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesperson, said he could not comment. Mabunda, who at his farewell function said the parting of the ways was amicable, was inaugurated as an honorary professor in natural sciences at the beginning of the month after his nomination by the Oxford Academic Union.
