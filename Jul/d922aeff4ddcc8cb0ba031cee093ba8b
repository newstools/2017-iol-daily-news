“We did a research study on youth tourism, as this was a gap we needed to address,” said Roshni Mehta, a researcher in the business intelligence and product quality department at Durban Tourism. The province boasts the country’s top boarding schools, with almost 40% of students being from other countries, such as Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, China and India. Durban Tourism researchers quizzed the international students about their influences and expectations on long-haul destinations and patterns. Their views are important, said Mehta, as they were able to influence their friends and families to visit where they were studying, and some of their families invest in houses in the area. Having found out what experiences they expect when they travel internationally, Durban Tourism then came with a 10-minute documentary featuring what is available in the area to attract the youth. It was launched at the Durban ICC on Wednesday. The documentary, showing extreme adventure, a variety of sports and leisure attractions and activities, portrays Durban as a fast-paced urban African city that appeals to the young and the young-at-heart. It would be available on the Durban Tourism website, on the websites of the product owners whose attractions feature in the documentary and it would go to community tourism organisations and to Michaelhouse and Durban Boys' High School, whose students contributed to the research. Also, keeping up with the latest trends, Durban Tourism also launched its first accommodation app yesterday, allowing visitors to get information on their devices on more than 700 accommodation places in Durban, as well the location of the nearest attractions, garages, banks, restaurants and shopping malls.
