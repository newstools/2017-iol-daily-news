DURBAN - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) finds it suspicious that government has failed to capture the people who broke into offices of law-enforcement agencies. The statement by the IFP comes after reports of another break-in, this time into the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, Matric Luphondo, on Wednesday morning. Joshua Mazibuko, IFP Deputy National Spokesperson, said it is unacceptable that there have been three burglaries at law-enforcement agencies’ offices and no reports of arrests about the first two break-ins. However, after the burglary at the Chief Justice’s office, a statement issued by the South African Government announced that the South African Police Service had three suspects in custody. “That we have this third break-in which happened in the Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor is clear evidence that criminals have gained confidence that no one will ever touch them,” said Mazibuko. He also said what fascinates them is the fact that the break-ins take place in offices that should be extremely guarded. “This may be attributed to two things: either these criminals have covert companions in positions of authority or our police are impotent against criminals,” continued Mazibuko. Further, he said the message these happenings send to South Africans is that they are on their own, without any protection from relevant organs of government. In March, the Chief Justice’s office was broken into and 15 computers with confidential information were stolen. In July, there was a burglary at the Hawks offices in Pretoria and their computers were also stolen. The South African Police Service could not be reached at the time of publication, however the article will be updated when they comment. Daily News
