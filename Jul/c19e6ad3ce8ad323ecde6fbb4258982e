DURBAN - The headless body of an unknown person was found in Tongaat by members of a private security company on Tuesday. Reaction Unit South Africa officers received information that a body was lying near a sports ground close to the R102 at about 11.30 am. After searching in the area, an officer found a partially clothed body lying under a few branches. “Upon closer inspection the reaction officer found that the head and left leg had been removed. The chest area had also been cut open. It could not be confirmed if the organs had been removed,” said Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram. “The sex and race of the victim could not be immediately established.” In an earlier incident, a man stabbed his 23-year-old nephew at a Verulam taxi rank, apparently over the sale of cigarettes. A taxi drove to the Rusa headquarters with a critically injured man in the front seat. “The driver explained that the victim was stabbed by his uncle after he was found selling cigarettes in the same area that a family business operated,” said Balram.
