DURBAN - Firefighters contained a fire from spreading through a city building at the corner of Anton Lembede (Smith) and Samora Machel (Aliwal) streets in Durban on Monday morning. The fire started in an office and spread to two others on the seventh floor of the Wesley Centre building, which also houses the Central Methodist Church, just after 7am, said Durban Fire department Divisional Commander Trevor Stevens. Firemen broke their way into the offices after being alerted by the The Association For The Aged (TAFTA), whose building adjourns it. Tafta CEO Femada Shamam said residents living closer to Wesley Centre saw the smoke and flames and alerted the supervisor. Shamam said some of the 209 residents of TAFTA were evacuated from their flats and taken to the service centre in the building. The heat from the fire was intense and breaking glass fell from the burning offices to the TAFTA parking area. "Some of the residents were in shock, but there were no injuries to anyone from TAFTA. Three of our staff members used fire hoses from our building to contain the fire before the fire department arrived," Shamam said. Wesley Centre students, some still in their pyjamas, stood on the pavement watching the firemen at work.Â 
Stevens said the cause of the fire would be investigated. Daily News
