Khulekani Mkhulise, 25, has already appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrateâ€™s Court for the attempted murder of the officer and for possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. He was arrested in the France area of Pietermaritzburg last week after a joint operation by the Alexandra Road Trio Crime detectives, the K9 Unit and Ixopo detectives. Two days earlier, members of the K9 Unit received a tip-off about a man travelling in a Toyota Tazz who was believed to have an unlicensed weapon. After spotting the vehicle, they gave chase into France, said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele. The driver jumped out of the car and fired shots at the police, injuring a 53-year-old member of the K9 Unit and fled. In a joint operation, the police went to his hiding place and allegedly found Mkhulise with a 9mm pistol. Investigations revealed that the firearm was linked to a case in Isipingo. Police say Mkhulise was wanted for two counts of attempted murder and murder in Ixopo. He was remanded until Thursday. Daily News
