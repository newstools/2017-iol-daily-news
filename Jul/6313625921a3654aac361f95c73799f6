Dlamini Zuma was speaking to Independent Media at Fingo Village in Grahamstown on Tuesday, after visiting uMkhonto weSizwe veteran Sindile Moyikwa’s homestead. Moyikwa, 59, died of natural causes a few days ago. He is expected to be buried on ­Saturday. “Comrade Moyikwa was a freedom fighter. He fought for this country and we are grateful for his contribution to the South Africa we have today,” she told members of his family on Tuesday. She had also visited patients at the nearby Temba TB Hospital as part of her Mandela Day activities. The former AU Commission chairperson said Mandela was the embodiment of a leader who many could look up to. “Comrade Mandela, together with other comrades that he worked with, taught us to love our country. Our youth should emulate the work of Mandela and many of our leaders by ­having necessary skills to develop the country. “Mandela loved children and made every effort to make sure that women were protected from intimidation and abuse. He taught us to love and protect women and their children. We need to be patriotic and love one another,” Dlamini Zuma said. Lecture Dlamini Zuma addressed a public lecture on the Agenda 2063, organised by Rhodes University’s department of political and international studies. Agenda 2063 is the AU’s strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years. It builds on and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development. Dlamini Zuma said it was time that Africans started to believe in themselves. “As Africans we must change our mindset and start to believe in ourselves. It is possible for us to build a prosperous and peaceful Africa. We all have to contribute towards that project.” On the Grahamstown tour, Dlamini Zuma was accompanied by ANC provincial executive committee member Andile Lungisa, among others. Daily News
