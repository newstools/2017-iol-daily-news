DURBAN - A fully developed female foetus was found in a bin on Todd Street in the centre of Verulam at midday on Monday. Security guards of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) were stopped by a vendor who had asked them to help after a homeless person found the remains of the baby while searching for food in a vacant area. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said they found a fully developed foetus as well as the placenta, covered in dirt inside a municipal bin. “The umbilical cord was wrapped around the child’s neck. A large group of onlookers gathered at the scene and expressed their anger at the selfish act by the mother,” he said. Rusa received information that the child was delivered prematurely by one of several sex workers in the area. Earlier this month a newborn baby was found in a pit latrine at Shaka’s Head, outside Ballito. Daily News
