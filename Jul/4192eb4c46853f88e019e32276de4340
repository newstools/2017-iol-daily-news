Professor Thenjiwe Meyiwa, institutional registrar, said the university’s executive management and the Students Representative Council (SRC) met this week regarding registration and the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). Management decided to suspend lectures from Wednesday until Thursday.  The suspension would give DUT the chance to discuss the issues, Meyiwa said. “The university is not closing and our administration and support services will be operational. The academic programme will start on Monday.” The SRC demands that NSFAS payments for students be completed and accommodation problems be resolved. In a memorandum, the SRC said students could not register because they owed money. “We demand a more flexible and accommodative system for instalment plans and that all students who owe less than R10000 be unblocked for registration, provided they sign an acknowledgement-of-debt form,” the SRC said. It also demanded the institution fully fund students who come from quintile 1 to 3 schools. They said the Department of Higher Education had made a commitment that these students would be funded.  Mbuso Sithole, SRC deputy secretary, said they had been speaking to students at meetings this week.  There was progress, Sithole said, as students had received text messages saying NSFAS funds were deposited. On social media, students had mixed feelings about the suspension. Some expressed mistrust of the SRC. Others  felt some of their needs would be met. Daily News
