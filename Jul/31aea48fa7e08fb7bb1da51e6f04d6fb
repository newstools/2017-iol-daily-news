GAUTENG Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has expressed "shock and sadness" over the death of two soccer fans in a stampede at the Soweto derby between Kaiser Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. Two people were trampled to death and 19 others were hurt - one of them critically when fans tried to force their way past a security gate at the FNB Stadium a few minutes before the game started on Saturday afternoon. However, the game continued and Kaizer Chiefs lifted the Carling Black Label Cup with a 1-0 win over rivals Orlando Pirates, now questions are being asked as to what happened and why the game was allowed to continue. At the weekend stadium authorities said they decided to let the game go on to avoid the possible chaos that could have resulted if they had canceled the match attended by a capacity 90,000 fans. "I am deeply saddened by the passing away of supporters and injuries sustained at the FNB Stadium. This incident is unfortunate as security plans are always in place from a law enforcement agencies perspective," said Nkosi-Malobane at the weekend. "I convey my deepest condolences to the families who lost their loved ones during the stampede and also wish all those who were injured a speedy recovery. I am confident that our law enforcement agencies will work around the clock to investigate the main cause of the stampede leading to fatalities and ensure that the similar incident does not occur in future.” The stampede was thought to have been sparked by people who had bought fake tickets. - African News Agency (ANA)
