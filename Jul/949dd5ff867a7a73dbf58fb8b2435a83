DURBAN - The Department of Basic Education has started a process of consultation on proposed amendments to pass requirements for pupils in Grades 1 to 9 which would see mathematics removed as a compulsory pass requirement.
These proposals are to align pass requirements with that of Grades 10 to 12. When pass marks were introduced for Grades 10 to 12 in 2014, those for lower grades were not adjusted, department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. Pass requirements for pupils in Grades 10 to 12 are: 40% in three subjects, one of which is an official language at home-language level. 30% in three subjects. Proposed amendments for Grades 7 to 9 are: Pass four subjects at 40%, one of which is a home language. Pass any other four subjects at 30%. Maths removed as a compulsory promotion requirement. In 2009, a task team established by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga to investigate poor curriculum implementation in schools recommended, among others, changes to the programme and promotion requirements in Grades 1 to 9. The department would now embark on a broad consultation process with advisers, assessment experts, higher education institutions, parents and members of the public on the amendments to the foundation, intermediate and senior phase promotion requirements, Mhlanga said. SA Democratic Teachersâ€™ Union (Sadtu) general secretary Mugwena Maluleke said while pass requirements had to be revised from time to time, the Education Department must also examine the effect it would have on pupils who wanted to study further. Universities felt many students spent too much time in bridging courses, Maluleke said, and pass marks at schools needed to equip pupils with the skills and confidence to survive tertiary education. Sadtu would study the new proposed amendments and make recommendations to the department, Maluleke said. Daily News
