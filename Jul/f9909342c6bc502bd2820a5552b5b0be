He berated former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe, and former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, for “sharing a stage with FW de Klerk”. “If you understand politics, can you share a platform with De Klerk and make him a first speaker?” Zuma asked supporters. “You must know that those who do so, their politics are suspicious,” Zuma said. “There are those who stand there and say things, and because they are not being responded to, they think they know it all. “They must know that those who are not responding to them don’t want to exacerbate the wrong thing because they are politically clear,” he added. Zuma said those who were politically clear were sworn at, but he told them not to worry. He said time would tell when those who publicly criticised the party daily would be on their own. Zuma said he was looking forward to the party’s elective conference in December so that he could respond to his critics “without restrictions”. He also said that the term “corruption” was used by opposition parties to “push a negative narrative”. “These opposition parties are in trouble because they can’t tell people that we don’t have good policies, we have superior policies. “That’s why they hang on to this word, ‘corruption’, because they have nothing more to say,” Zuma said. He implored the youth to lift the country and its people out of the clutches of poverty and unemployment. “The youth must know that we were not born like this, us black people. “Let us stand up. We can’t fail to address the land question. We are sitting here because the land was taken from us. It created social challenges and stripped us of our dignity,” Zuma said.
