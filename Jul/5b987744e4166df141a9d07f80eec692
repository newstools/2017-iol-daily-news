Her response comes after a statement issued by the legal watchdog barring her from portraying herself as an attorney. Sigamoney, former Durban Chamber of Commerce vice-president, according to the statement, is further ordered to remove all material both in print and electronic form that refers to her as an attorney and must pay the financial costs of the court application. Umesh Jivan, KZN Law Society president, said the application against Sigamoney was launched in the Pietermaritzburg High Court in April. The matter dates back to an article published in the Sunday Tribune in June last year. The journalist referred to Sigamoney as a lawyer. In papers filed before the court, it stated that an anonymous caller alerted the society to the fact that Sigamoney was “masquerading as an attorney”. The publication requested the case file pertaining to the investigation. The society responded, confirming that Sigamoney was not a registered attorney. The society further stated that Sigamoney claimed to be able to handle “employment litigation”. However in August last year, Sigamoney was asked about the contents of the article and she denied claiming to be an attorney. The letter asked if Sigamoney told the journalist that she was a lawyer, if she noticed that she was referred to as a lawyer and if she had taken any steps to correct the error. Follow-up investigations found that she failed to respond to all the complaints raised. Speaking to the Daily News, Sigamoney said she never claimed to be a lawyer. Daily News
