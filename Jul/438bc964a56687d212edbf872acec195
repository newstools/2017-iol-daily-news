DURBAN – African National Congress (ANC) secretary in KwaZulu-Natal, Super Zuma, on Wednesday said MP Makhosi Khoza, who has openly called for party leader President Jacob Zuma to step down, has now been charged and there would be no more public discussions on the matter. Khoza was officially charged on Tuesday and according to ANC KZN spokesperson, Mdumiseni Ntuli. She confirmed receiving the charge sheet.
 The charge sheet reportedly has 11 charges including bring the ANC into disrepute, which Khosa is expected to respond to before a discipline hearing is conducted. “She is permitted to be represented at the hearing preferably by another ANC member in good standing,” ANC KZN spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli told ANA. He said it was not ANC policy to make public the charge sheet. “From our side as the ANC, we have closed public discussion on this matter,” said Zuma.
 In recent weeks Khoza has become increasingly outspoken against the ANC’s "blind loyalty" to party leader President Zuma. The outspoken ANC MP faces charges of contravening the party’s rules due to her numerous public utterances in which she has intimated she would vote for the removal of Zuma if Parliament was to have a secret ballot over the President’s fitness to remain in office. The vote is scheduled for 8 August. House speaker Baleka Mbete has yet to decide if the vote will be secret or not.
