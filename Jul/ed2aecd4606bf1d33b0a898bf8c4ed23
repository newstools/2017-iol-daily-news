Mahoshni Naidoo had prepared a pre-sentencing report for the court. Thuso Thelejane, Mlungisi Ndlovu, Mbali Magwala and Sbonakaliso Mbili were convicted by Judge Thoba Poyo-Dlwati in January. Thelejane, Ndlovu and Magwala were minors at the time of Murugan’s murder in 2014. Her decapitated body was found on a field in Shallcross, while her head was found in a shallow grave at Mbili’s home on the South Coast. Murugan had 192 stab wounds on her body. Mbili is a traditional healer and reportedly offered the three R2million for the head of a white, coloured or Indian woman. In her reports submitted to the court, Naidoo said Thelejane, Ndlovu and Magwala would benefit from the programmes offered in prison, if they wanted to participate in them. Naidoo’s reports on the three were based on interviews conducted with them, their families and Murugan’s family. Senior State advocate Cheryl Naidu questioned the social worker about Ndlovu. She said Ndlovu’s mother said he was deeply affected by his father’s death in 2013, a year before Murugan’s death. “He was a well-behaved boy and when his father passed away, he had no role-model,” she said. Naidoo added that during the interview process, Ndlovu showed no remorse for the incident. In discussing her report on Magwala, Naidoo said she also did not show any remorse during her interview. “She thought that the money she would get would help her live a better lifestyle.” Magwala’s lawyer, Rema Mahabeer, argued that Naidoo had not furnished documents from her interviews to the court. She said Naidoo had merely based her report on hearsay from those she had interviewed and, by the language Naidoo used in her report, she was biased. Further, Mahabeer said vital information was missing from Naidoo’s report on her client. Naidoo then had to give her interview notes to Mahabeer during a court interval. Arguments for sentencing continue on Friday. Daily News
