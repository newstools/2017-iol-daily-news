DURBAN - An eleven year old boy probably saved his nine year old brother’s life after the younger boy was knocked by a car on Thursday afternoon.
 
According to a statement issued by Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), a private security company, the incident happened on Inanda Road, near Trenance Park at about 4pm.
 
It seems as though both boys ran down a steep embankment. The younger one failed to stop and ran into the rear end of a passing vehicle. During the impact his leg broke. The older brother then dragged him off the road, preventing him from being further injured.
 
“Paramedics found that the nine year suffered a broken right leg and bodily injuries after being run over by a light motor vehicle. He was treated on scene and transported to Osindisweni Hospital,” read the statement. Daily News
