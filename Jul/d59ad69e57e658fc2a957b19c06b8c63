This was the warning issued by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) on Sunday, following several investigations into Eskom officials. Themba Godi, Scopa chairperson, said the country should not relent in the fight against corruption. He said corruption was a cancer that needed to be eradicated from society. Several state-owned enterprises (SoEs) have been embroiled in allegations of state capture, with the Guptas fingered at the centre of the allegations. On Sunday, a National Treasury report into coal contracts at Eskom involving  the Guptas had recommended action against top officials at the power utility. The report has called for probes against Brian Molefe, the former chief executive, and his successor, Matshela Koko, currently on suspension. Last June former finance minister Pravin Gordhan complained in Parliament that Eskom was refusing to hand over more than 200 pages of documents on the coal contracts with the Guptas as part of their investigation. This led to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown forcing Eskom to submit the documents to Treasury. The Treasury was supposed to give Scopa its report on this investigation last November, but said the probe had not been completed. It mentioned lack of co-operation by Eskom. Godi said the fact that the report had been completed would give them an opportunity to discuss it. He would not say when Scopa would meet to discuss the report and its implications. This is one of several probes into the company, including another one ordered by Brown that would involve the Special Investigating Unit. Daily News
