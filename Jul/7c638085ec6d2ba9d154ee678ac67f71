Constable Wenkosi Khwela, 31, had gone to court to support his colleagues, Bhekani Dladla and Sipho Masango, also constables, but found himself arrested before entering the courtroom. He then joined his colleagues in the dock at F Court, where Dladla, 30, and Masango, 37, were expected to make their formal bail application. Moses Dlamini, spokesperson for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, said Khwela was charged with corruption and assault causing grievous bodily harm. Dladla and Masango appeared previously on the same charges and were released on bail of R2500 each. Days after their release, Dladla and Masango were arrested for corruption and remanded at Westville Prison. Dlamini said a further charge of intimidation would be added to the charge sheet for Dladla and Masango. It is alleged that when the victim laid a charge against the officers, the two went to his house and threatened to kill him if he did not drop 
the charges. The matter dates back to an incident in May where Dladla and Masango allegedly set their dogs on a man. The Daily News reported that the two officers allegedly accused the man of being a hijacker. They then took him to a secluded spot where police dogs attacked the victim and a friend. In an interview with the Daily News, the victim claimed that he was severely injured and needed a wheelchair. He further claimed that he feared for his life and had to leave KwaZulu-Natal for fear of being harmed. Speaking on behalf of his clients, Advocate Tommy Reed said the policemen intended to plead not guilty. Magistrate Mabaso ruled that the matter be adjourned to July26 for a formal bail application. The men were all remanded at Westville Prison. Daily News
