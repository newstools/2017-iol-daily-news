Last week, posters circulated via social media stating that Moodley was to speak at an event for the Active Citizens Movement (ACM) in uMhlanga. Moodley, who was referred to on the poster as Dr Des Moodley, Peer’s adviser, was to speak alongside Professor Hoosen Coovadia and councillor Heinz de Boer. In a statement, the eThekwini Municipality said Peer had under no circumstances given Moodley the title of adviser. “Furthermore, no one has been appointed in deputy mayor Peer’s office under that title. As a committed councillor and community leader who is passionate about efficient and effective service delivery, the deputy mayor works with many people from the community to fight crime and social ills, and maintains a good working relationship with them,” the statement read. Peer had expressed her disappointment at the allegations being made by Moodley and called them unfounded. “Deputy mayor Peer has further cautioned people to refrain from using her name to further their own objectives,” the statement said. Yashica Padia, ACM spokesperson, said it got the information about Moodley from a member at the uMhlanga branch, who conveyed the details to the branch 
organiser. “The information ultimately came from Des Moodley and we took it on good faith. When Fawzia Peer wrote a letter asking for the matter to be rectified, we removed Des from the programme. We will still respond to the letter sent by the deputy mayor clarifying the matter,” she said. Padia said she was unaware if Moodley had attended the meeting. Moodley had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
