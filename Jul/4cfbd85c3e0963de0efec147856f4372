VILAKAZI Street in Orlando West, Soweto, famed for having two Nobel Prize winners - Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu - live there, now has CCTV cameras to beef up security. During the launch of the CCTV system, Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba on Wednesday said: "Anything that happens in this street affects the whole City of Johannesburg and South Africa". The CCTV cameras were launched at the Sakhumzi Restaurant in Orlando West,Soweto. The launch comes after the murder of Kwesi Hudson, the manager of Sakhumzi Restaurant. Hudson was shot dead in cold blood outside the restaurant February this year. At the time of the murder, Mashaba promised to install CCTV cameras to improve safety in the area for residents and visiting tourists. The mayor said the move sends a message that there is a "war against criminality" in Johannesburg. He said technology will assist in that regard. "Safety has to be our key priority to keep tourists coming to the street." Member of the Mayoral Committee for Public Safety Michael Sun said the CCTV technology was advanced and would complement the rather limited police patrols. "We are where we are because the government has always helped Sakhumzi Restaurant, we currently have 110 people working full time," Sakhumzi Restaurant owner, Sakhumzi Maqubela said after the CCTV cameras were turned on.
