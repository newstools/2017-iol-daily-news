DURBAN - Anita Akal, the Greyville Racecourse photographer, always thought she would get run over by a horse one day. And, although she finally came a cropper at the racecourse in January, her accident had nothing to do with a horse. I had just come from the track and must still have had grass on my shoes. When I got to the tunnel, it was raining and slippery, she recalled.She skidded and crashed to the ground but, despite the pain, her first thought was for her camera. I wondered if it had been damaged, but luckily it hadn t, she said. It was a serious fracture. I broke my hip, she said.Akal takes photos for owners, trainers and jockeys and, while she was out of action, her daughter Anneke Kitching took her place. But I always told my doctor that by hook or by crook, I needed to be okay for the Vodacom Durban July, Akal said.She made her first public appearance, after being laid up for months, at last week s lunchtime final draw for the horses which will be battling it out tomorrow.Gold Circle guests made a fuss of Akal, telling her they were glad she was back. And yes, I am back in time for the big race tomorrow, she said yesterday as she collected her official photographer s bib.Saturday will be the 46th Durban July that she will have covered. I am aiming for my 50th Vodacom Durban July, she vowed.Daily News
