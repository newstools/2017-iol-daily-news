DURBAN - The body of a foetus was found wrapped in a plastic bag on Hill Street in Pinetown on Wednesday morning. ER24 paramedics received a call to the scene after someone had spotted the foetus among the rubbish. “Upon arrival, paramedics found the body wrapped in a plastic bag next to a rubbish bin.
It was evident to paramedics that the foetus had been dead for some time,” said Russel Meiring of ER24. Meiring said the foetus was a boy and it still had the placenta attached to it. Upon closer inspection, paramedics found that the foetus had a wound on the right side of its neck. Police were on the scene and are investigating. This comes two days after the body of a baby girl was found dumped in a municipal bin in Verulam, and earlier in the month, a newborn baby was found in a pit latrine at Shaka’s Head, outside Ballito.
