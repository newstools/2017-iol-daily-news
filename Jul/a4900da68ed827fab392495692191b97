Boudraa arrived in Durban this weekend from Port Shepstone after leaving Cape Town more than a week ago. His incredible journey on a bicycle started in March last year when he cycled out of Ville De Kenitra, his home town, with two bags filled with a tent and utensils, shoes and clothing. He went through Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Niger, Gabon, the Congo, Zambia and  Mozambique. Boudraa travelled an average of 100km a day and has done about 20000km. He left home with $300 (R3885) and spent it all before he reached Senegal. “I relied on the hospitality of people on the route. I met villagers and people in cities who knew my story and were fascinated by the tales I told them about life in Morocco. People in Africa have good hearts,” Boudraa said. His main challenges were punctures, worn shoes, food and insects. “I was struck down with Malaria a few times but lucky to get treatment. I navigated using my cellphone and Google maps and asked locals for maps in case my phone battery died,” Boudraa said outside a mosque in Samora Machel (Aliwal) Street. He was welcomed to Durban by a fellow Moroccan, known only as Hassan, who came across Boudraa while looking through his cousin’s Facebook profile in Cape Town. Hassan introduced him to Durban architect Yusuf Patel, who is trying to get him sponsors for a GoPro camera or portable gas cooker. While Boudraa’s bicycle is being repaired, he is taking in the sights of Durban. He plans to leave later this week for Mozambique. Daily News
