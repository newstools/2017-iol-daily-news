“This blatant propaganda is fake news at its best which cannot be taken seriously by any reasonable person,” its statement read. Herbst’s article refers to the fact that Survé is not mentioned as a doctor who treated Nelson Mandela in Dr Vejay Ramlakan’s controversial book, Mandela’s Last Years, despite Survé having served as a doctor to Mandela and other Robben Island prisoners. The article also revives previous attacks by other detractors on Survé and his ownership of Independent Media. “Once again BizNews is running a piece, with flagrant disregard for the facts,” the statement read. It condemned the “obsession with Dr Survé and his business interests” and asked why anyone would keep searching for evidence of his relationship with Mandela - the focus of the article - and then try to connect it with an event being arranged by the Daily Maverick (DM). Herbst’s article says it would be interesting to see if Survé “shows up” at the media event in Cape Town on August 3. However Survé had earlier declined the invitation due to other commitments, and is not participating. The DM website has been updated and does not list him as a speaker. Daily News
