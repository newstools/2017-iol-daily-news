Your Mandela money, or your Mandela time? KwaZulu-Natal non-governmental organisations this week spoke about how donations of R67 by many people could hit the spot better than 67 minutes of their time on Mandela Day, when it comes to meeting their real needs. Childline KZN operations manager Adeshini Naicker said organisations go all-out for Mandela Day. “As a result, these organisations become inundated with items as well as perishables. There are often up to five different corporates visiting the same organisations. And while these organisations welcome these visits, they are often left with a massive amount of perishables,” said Naicker. “An active difference would be if each person donated R67 to an NGO or charity of their choice on Mandela Day, this would go a long way because small donations have the potential to drastically improve an individual’s quality of life." Caro Smit, director of South Africans Against Drunken Driving, said it would use such donations to fit injured people with prostheses. The street children organisation, I Care, said donations of non-perishable foods, clothes and money were much more beneficial to an NGO than an actual 67 minutes of a person’s time. Walter Petersen, manager at the Durban branch of the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca), said the idea of money over time was “too mercenary”. “For someone who earns a low wage, R67 can mean more than a couple of loaves of bread.” On the animal front, Kloof SPCA  manager Barbara Patrick said it encouraged its community to spend Mandela Day helping with its various projects, such as walking dogs, making cat toys and doing  mosaics and gardening.
