This is the first time in 21 years that the tournament is being hosted in Durban. Erick Takawira, President of the KwaZulu-Natal Chess Association, said holding the tournament in Durban was “part of a dream to make KwaZulu-Natal the Mecca of chess”. It took them two months to prepare for the tournament, which has seen more than 400 participants entering. The winner of the main section of the competition will receive R20 000. There is also a section for veterans - 50 years and over - whose winner will receive R500. The winner of the U18 and lower age groups will each also receive R500. The tournament is being held at Glenwood High School with the prize-giving ceremony being held on Saturday. Takawira said the tournament was also hosting 21-year-old Indian grandmaster Sahaj Grover, who will be sharing his knowledge through coaching lectures. Grover will also take part in an exhibition match, playing against 20 people simultaneously. The players to look out for from KZN, Takawira said, were Joseph Mwale and Nashlen Govindasamy. The provincial president said Govindasamy nearly caused an upset earlier on when he played Grover in a match and put the young grandmaster under pressure. Daily News
