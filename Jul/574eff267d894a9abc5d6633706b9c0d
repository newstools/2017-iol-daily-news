Durban - Pupils  from Bechet High School gathered on Moses Kotane (Sparks) Road on Thursday, held a placard demonstration for a reduced speed limit on a stretch of road that the community believes has killed 50 people. The most recent death was in May when a 7-year old boy was killed after he was hit by a car while trying to cross the road. Two weeks ago, another pupil was seriously injured in another crash. Professor Jennifer Subban orchestrated Thursday's demonstration. "This is part of the Wright Lead Progamme which trains youth with leadership skills to improve their communities. Today this about advocacy to improve safety on Sparks Road because too many children have lost their lives as a result of excessive speed on this road," she said. The pupils have selected this as one of their service project for this year. On Wednesday they petitioned residents to address the high number of deaths on Moses Kotane Road. Subban, formerly of Sydenham and a pupil at Bechet, now living in the USA, said pupils planned the placard demonstration on their own. Ward councillor Chris Pappas, ward was at the demonstration said he was glad to see young people standing up. "Under adult supervision there is action being taken. We know that speed humps cannot be installed but we know there are some speed calming measures that can be placed.  We have been trying to get something done for years," said Pappas. He said at the last community meeting only the Metro Police attended. "This is despite an open invite to the deputy mayor and other officials.  We are thankful to Metro for availing themselves and for the speed trapping operations tney have been holding," said Pappas. Three petitions were handed over to Pappas who will hand them over to the City Manager, Mayor and MEC for Community Safety and Liaison. Daily News
