Parents were up in arms about the Department of Education’s (DoE) decision to place a new principal at the school. At a meeting last night at the Austerville Community Centre, Andre de Bruin, school governing body (SGB) chairperson, said the proposed new principal would not be placed at the school until the DoE had looked into their grievances. “A meeting was held between members of the SGB and officials from the Department of Education. We agreed to put the position on hold while the due process is looked into. We need to look into the scoring and the motivation letter that the interview committee looked at. If that fails, a motivation letter will be sent to the MEC,” he said. Until then, the proposed principal, Sharon Ndlovu, will not be at Assegai. While SGB members met officials in offices in Umbilo, a group of parents protested peacefully outside. The group said its request had nothing to do with race, but it deserved to know that a fair selection process was followed. Just days before the school was expected to open, it was announced that the department had appointed Ndlovu, a high-school teacher with a level 1 qualification, as principal. This news was met with consternation from parents and the SGB. They believed that Odette Abrahams Field was the best choice. Field has been deputy principal at Assegai for the past 24 years.
