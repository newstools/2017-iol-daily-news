He described Magaqa as a “strong man who will survive”. “He has stomached the bullets and will continue fighting,” Stuta said. This came after Magaqa, now a PR councillor in the uMzimkhulu Municipality, and two other councillors, Jabu Msiya and Nsiki Mafa, were shot after they had stopped at a store in the Ibisi area last week . All three are said to be recovering in hospital. Political violence has plagued the area this year. Stuta, who has been friends with Magaqa for more than 20 years, said: “We will soldier on and will not be silenced by guns. Magaqa, a father of four, is someone who is outspoken and will point out anything he does not like,” Stuta said. His friend did not want to speak about the shooting, said Stuta, as he was still in pain. Recalling events from last week, Stuta said his friend was on his way home with two other people when the attack took place. “They stopped at Ibisi to buy something. “That’s when the attack happened.” He said Magaqa was shot five times in the body and there were 46 cartridges found at the scene. “They wanted to make sure he died. The car was riddled with bullets,” Stuta said. Daily News
