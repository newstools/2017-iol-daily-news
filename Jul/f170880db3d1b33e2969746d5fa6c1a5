About 24000 pupils from 73 different countries participated in the fair, where nearly 600 projects were display. Saanthin Perumal and Ryan Ramiah, both 16, won a silver medal for their Citrus Power innovation. They said food waste offered a tantalising source of renewable biofuel and orange peels were an example of the potential. Perumal estimated that global agriculture produces about 15.6 million tons of orange and other citrus waste annually in the form of discarded peels. Their aim is to extract useful oils within the peels to produce an essential oil or biofuel. “We will incorporate such oil into a product which is reliant on petroleum and replace the expensive fossil fuel. The oils produced from the peels are useful in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other industrial appliances,” he said. Sashen Naidoo and Ayush Chunilall, also 16, created an automatic plant Eco Watering System. It monitors weather forecasts and adjusts itself to comply with anticipated moisture levels. The aim of this project was to design and develop a soil irrigation system which reduces fuel, labour, water and electricity costs, protecting the environment and its finite resources. They won a bronze medal. Naidoo heads to Namibia next month for the International Expo African Science Fair. Nikita Chitanand and Tarini Nadasen won gold for harnessing heat energy from a car to produce electricity, while Yasha Sapry and Simran Rathilal harnessed wind energy to increase the vehicle’s efficiency.
