Shami Harichunder of Umgeni Water said they had made the application for the extension to the Department of Water Affairs and expected it to be approved and gazetted in the coming week. It will also be implemented retrospectively, as from July 1. The water restrictions had been made last year and were immediately implemented. Harichunder said: “The request for water restrictions to be extended was an outcome of a series of meetings of the Mgeni system Joint Operations Committee, the most recent of which was held on Thursday last week, and was in response to concerns over forecasts of below-average rainfall in the coming wet season.” He added: “One of the factors that influenced the decision to extend restrictions was forecasts by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the South African Weather Service that rainfall in the spring and summer months of 2017/18 are likely to be less than the average received.” This would be consistent with a trend from the past three years of below-average rainfall being received. This has resulted in the Midmar and Albert Falls dams being at low levels. The restrictions would affect uMgungundlovu District, all of Pietermaritzburg, the greater part of Durban and south of Ugu District, Harichunder said. It would also affect businesses and industry, government services and households which form part of an estimated four million consumers. He said the average for all dams in their system stood at 60% but they needed water levels to be at 70% at the end of every rainfall season, which ends in May. When the 70% mark is reached, water restrictions would be lifted. Daily News
