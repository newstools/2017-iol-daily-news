DURBAN - The KZN Youth Choir landed home on Sunday after two-and-a-half weeks on tour in Spain, where they participated in the international choir competition the “Golden Voices of Barcelona”. The choir had entered in five categories: Academic, Sacred, Gospel, Folk and Chamber. They came in first place in the first four categories and second in the chamber category. The choir performed in cities on the way from Madrid to Barcelona and also had the rare opportunity of performing at the heart of Barcelona, in Sagrada Familia. Of the 65 choristers on tour, three were Durban High School pupils: Cohen Naidoo, Senzo Langazana and Nkanyisa Gasa. Grade 11 pupil Cohen Naidoo has represented the KZN Youth Choir for the past two years, has been a chorister for the last eight years and is a self-taught guitarist. He began singing in the choir at Durban Preparatory High School in grade 4 and has been a chorister in the Durban High School Deo Fretus Choir since grade 8. Senzo Langazana and Nkanyisa Gasa are in grade 12 and have also been choristers of the DHS Deo Fretus Choir since grade 8. Langazana was a member of the Glenwood Prep Choir in grades 2 and 3, and in the Penzance Choir in grades 6 and 7. The “Golden Voices of Barcelona” competition is the biggest and most renowned choir competition in the world, and gives choral groups the opportunity to perform in some of Europe’s most famous Catholic churches. Durban High School said it was proud of the boys, for not only representing the school and province, but also for representing South Africa. Daily News
