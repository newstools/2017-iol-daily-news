Horse racing fans, fashionistas and music lovers each year make their way to the little town of Dundee for a weekend of fun, parties and a chance to catch a breath of fresh air. The town comes alive every July when thousands of people arrive, regardless of extremely cold weather, in the place of many historic battlefields. On Saturday fans can watch eight races on the Dundee horse racing track, featuring local breeds against horses from neighbouring regions including the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Gauteng, as well as Lesotho. This yearâ€™s theme, Afro-
Athleisure, is the latest trend in global fashion inspired by the creative use of active sportswear as everyday stylish clothing. KZN Fashion Council programme manager Xolani Zulu said the theme would inspire designers to come up with original designs to produce fashionable garments for a traditional horse racing day.
