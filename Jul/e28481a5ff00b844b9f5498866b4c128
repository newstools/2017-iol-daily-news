Police escorted the small crowd of protesters as they made their way onto the lawn area of the Union Buildings. Wearing their black court robes and waving placards, the lawyers sang and danced, chanting slogans as they waited for an official from the Presidency to receive their memorandum. A statement from the BLA said the protest was directed at Zuma as the head of State because the State was the biggest consumer of legal services in the country. African News Agency (ANA)
