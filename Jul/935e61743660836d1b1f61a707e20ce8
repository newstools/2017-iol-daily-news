Durban - At least one shot was fired when a gang of armed robbers apparently fought among themselves as they fled the scene of a robbery in La Lucia Mall on Wednesday night. Blue Security media and community liaison officer Andreas Mathios said a gang of five suspects had entered the mall and robbed a cellphone shop. “Two suspects went into the shop and forced three staff members, who were working behind the counter attending to customers, to the back of the store where they pilfered an open safe of cellphones. The gang also held up a staff member at gunpoint and robbed her of jewellery,” Mathios said. Mathios said a Blue Security customer who was in the shop at the time had alerted the security company to the robbery in progress. “The gang shoved the goods into a duvet and fled from the store dropping some of the stolen goods as they ran. One of the suspects then grabbed a trolley and a cardboard box and as they tried to load the goods an argument broke out among the suspects and a shot was fired. The suspects fled in their getaway vehicle which was parked nearby,” Mathios said. Durban North police attended the scene of the crime. Daily News
