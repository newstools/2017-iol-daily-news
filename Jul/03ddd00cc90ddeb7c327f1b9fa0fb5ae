DURBAN - Vincent Mdunge, former KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, has lost another court battle to stay out of jail after the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed his application for leave to appeal against his conviction and five-year prison sentence. Mdunge had launched an SCA application on April 7, after the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed his appeal. In November 2014, he was found guilty of two counts of fraud and one count of forgery, in the Durban Regional Court. Magistrate Thandeka  Fikeni  found that he had presented a fake matric certification that secured him a promotion in the police services and entry to the University of South Africa (Unisa) to continue his studies. He then lodged an appeal in the high court and after this failed, he lodged an application for leave to appeal at the SCA. In June, the SCA dismissed this application for special leave to appeal on the grounds that there were no special circumstances meriting a further appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Mdunge had  21 days thereafter to take the matter further, that is approach the Constitutional Court, or report to the Department of Correctional Services to start serving his five year jail sentence. The Daily News has learnt, from a reliable source, that Mdunge has not made an application to the Constitutional Court and neither has he reported to prison. Despite several attempts by The Daily News, Mdunge has not commented on the matter. Mdunge had held the rank of colonel when he was arrested in October 2013, a month after he resigned when the fraud was discovered. He had 25 years of service with the police. Daily News
