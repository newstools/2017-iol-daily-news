CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) on Friday appealed to people to unite against sexual abuse and harassment and "support the victims of sexual abuse". The League made the statement in the wake of fresh allegations against the politically-connected Gupta brothers. A #GuptaLeaks report by the Scorpio and Amabhungane investigative units tells the tale of several women claiming to have been sexually harassed by two of the brothers. "Even though the reports are unverified at this stage, the ANCWL has always been firm that it stands with the victims of violence and sexual abuse and would like to reiterate this position," said Meokgo Mathuba, ANCWL secretary general. "The ANCWL calls on society to report all violence and sexual abuse acts to the law enforcement agencies for the law to take its course. We firmly believe in the principles of the freedom charter, which state that all shall be equal before the law and hopes for a fair and just trial as no one is above the law.
