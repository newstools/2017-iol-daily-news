The man was seated in his red BMW when he was approached by three armed men. The man’s friend, who did not want to be named, said they were in the car when she realised she had to get her clothing off the washing line. She went to her flat. “When I was walking back towards the car, one of the men approached me and told me to stop walking. “He took my phone,” she said. The men walked towards the BMW and fired shots through the closed door, hitting the driver. The man died at the scene. The woman was unharmed. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said police were investigating a case of murder. Daily News
