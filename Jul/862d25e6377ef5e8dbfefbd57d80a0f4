Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said yesterday that police were still investigating eight cases of culpable homicide and had opened three inquests in relation to the deaths. “The inquests are for the deaths of three female initiates and the culpable homicide cases are for the deaths of eight male initiates. I cannot say when the investigations will be concluded,” said Hlathi. The initiates died at different times in separate areas of the province, including KwaMhlanga and Belfast, he said. Musa Thugwana, chairperson of the Ingoma Forum, which is a platform created by the provincial Health Department to provide support at initiation schools, said the forum was satisfied with the conduct of parents during the current season. “Many of the parents complied with medical prescriptions before they sent their children to initiation schools. We had 31 deaths in the 2013 initiation season and the number has decreased,” said Thugwana. Hundreds of male initiates of the Ndebele ethnic group graduated and returned home on June 25. This was after they spent two months at initiation schools undergoing a rite of passage into manhood. Their families held ceremonies to welcome them and slaughtered different animals, including bulls and goats for a feast. One of the initiation school graduates, Mduduzi Ntuli, of Moloto village near KwaMhlanga, said he was initially scared of going to the initiation school because of 
deaths that occurred in previous seasons. “I just gathered courage and went to the mountains. Everything went well and I am glad I came back alive,” said the 19-year-old Grade 12 pupil. Mduduzi’s grandfather Solomon Mahlangu said he was not worried about the safety of his grandson before he went to the initiation school. “Our initiation practice is safe, but there are some people out there who do it in the wrong way,” he said.
