Mathys was in Durban last week to help plan the party’s fourth anniversary celebrations at Curries Fountain at the weekend. Mathys tweeted: “eThekwini means my favourite type of food - Indian! Gonna eat lots of it all week  no judging please  not all curry is Gupta” (sic). With more than 100 shares, the Daily News caught up with Mathys to find out if she had  squeezed in some authentic Durban curry. “Yep, every day since Sunday.  Unfortunately, my schedule has not  allowed me to go to some of my favourite Indian restaurants. Fortunately, Indian takeaways can be just as tasty,” said Mathys. She said last week she went to the Baking Pan, a popular eatery in Sydenham that she frequented during her school holidays. “This was decades ago. I go whenever I get a chance when I am in Durban. I ordered so much different food and had some of each. The bunny chow at Moyo uShaka is still yummy. I had that on Monday. My non-curry-eating colleagues were sweating after one mouthful and they ordered mild!” Mathys said she was disappointed on a trip to Durban earlier this year. “I went to Blue Lagoon, only to find out my favourite take-away joint was no longer there."
