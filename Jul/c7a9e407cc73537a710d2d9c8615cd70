DURBAN - The SA National Editors Forum (Sanef) filed an urgent application against Black First Land First (BLF) and its founder, Andile Mngxitama, at the High Court in Johannesburg on Tuesday. This comes after BLF members protested at the home of Tiso Blackstar editor-at-large Peter Bruce last Thursday and allegedly intimidated and harassed Business Day editor Tim Cohen and political commentator Karima Brown.BLF has since threatened more editors and journalists with similar protests at their private homes and have referred to Brown, Huffington Post SA editor-at-large Ferial Haffajee and Talk Radio 702 presenter Eusebius McKaiser as askaris .Sanef has asked the court to interdict BLF and Mngxitama from harassing, intimidating, assaulting and threatening 11 senior journalists, editors and commentators who have been targeted for their reporting on state capture.PartnerThe other applicants are Sam Sole, partner at investigative journalism unit amaBhungane; Adriaan Basson, News24 editor; Stephen Grootes, Talk Radio 702 presenter; independent journalist Max du Preez; Eyewitness News (EWN) editor Katy Katopodis; and EWN reporter Barry Bateman.In her founding affidavit, Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Gallens said the harassment of these journalists was an orchestrated campaign. Each one of the journalists have reported objectively and independently on the political state of the economy and the corruption and maladministration to further the interests of an elite few, Gallens said.The aim of the targeted harassment of these journalists was to keep allegations of corruption and state capture out of the public domain, she said.Sanef has asked the court to interdict BLF and Mngxitama from gathering outside the homes of these journalists; from threatening them with violence on social media, and from inciting harm against them in public interviews. An attack on one journalist can have a chilling effect on others, particularly when perpetrators can act with impunity, as the respondents (BLF and Mngxitama) do. African News Agency
