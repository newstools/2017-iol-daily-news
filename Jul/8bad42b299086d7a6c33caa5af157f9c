DURBAN - The DA’s spokesman on correctional services, James Selfe, has voiced his concerns over Schabir Shaik, who has been ‘terminally ill’ for eight years. In June, Selfe had posed a parliamentary question to the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Michael Masutha, about Shaik, who was released on parole eight years ago because he was said to be terminally ill at the time. The DA wanted to know the last medical assessment performed on Shaik, if his condition is still considered terminal, and what his life expectancy is. They also wanted to know the last date Shaik’s parole conditions were reviewed, the details of those conditions and whether Shaik had complied with his parole conditions. In response, Masutha said the last medical assessment was conducted before he was released on medical parole on March 3, 2009. According to the provisions of Section 79 of the Correctional Services Act, Act No. 111 of 1998 (before amendment) and Section 14 of the Correctional Services Amendment Act, Act No. 5 of 2011 (which came into effect on March 1, 2012), Shaik was in the final phase of his terminal disease. Shaik’s parole conditions were reviewed on April 24, 2015, with his house arrest conditions being relaxed:   Selfe was more concerned about Shaik’s house arrest conditions. “It is quite astounding that a terminally ill man is able to work and attend sports, should he wish,” he said. “It is also shocking that the last time his parole was assessed was two years ago. The reason for Mr Shaik’s release on parole 8 years ago was clearly a farce – he appears no closer to death today than he did at the time. Those responsible for this abuse and mockery of the parole system must be tracked down and held to account.” Daily News
