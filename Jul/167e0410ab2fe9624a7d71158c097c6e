DURBAN – Three African National Council (ANC) councillors from uMzimkhulu were shot on Thursday evening, while they were at a local shop together. Speaking to African News Agency (ANA) on Thursday night, ANC KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said that PR councillor Sindiso Magaqa, ward 11 councillor Nonsikelelo Mafa and ward 16 councillor Jabu Mzizi were shot.
 
Magaqa was the ANC Youth League secretary general before the league was disbanded in 2012. 
 
“The three of them were together when they were shot. It happened between 5.30pm and 6pm. I am getting updates every hour. The leadership of the region is at the hospital dealing with the comrades,” said Ntuli.
 
The trio were at a general dealer in ward 11, said Ntuli, when the shootings took place.
 
“They were parked outside a general dealer when a red BMW came, people got out and opened fire on them and drove off,” he said.
 
He said that depending on the injuries sustained, they might be moved to other hospitals.
 
Ntuli said it had not yet been confirmed if the three were returning from a council or committee meeting in town.
 
The shootings follow the killings of three other councillors in the area this year. The police were not immediately available for comment. African News Agency (ANA)
