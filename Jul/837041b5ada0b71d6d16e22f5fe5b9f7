The KwaMashu-born actress made the announcement during the festival’s launch at The Joint Cafe on Durban’s South Beach, where she was MC. “The pledge was un-
planned,” she said. “I know my team is surprised as well. I am like that when it comes to giving, I am radical. I feel it’s important for me to help the youth be part of this festival having experienced it myself and seen how this platform is important to the development of young people. There’s so much motivation at Essence Festival. “I don’t want only young people to attend the music festival. I want to see them at the business conference and motivational talks. There are so many opportunities and there’s so much to learn.” Earlier this month Mbatha dazzled international audiences when she hosted the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. That experience inspired her to provide an opportunity for other young people to  become part of the local Essence Festival set to take place from September 26 to October 1. The festival originated in New Orleans and returns to Durban for the second time under the theme “firing with inspiration”. Acting deputy city manager for economic development and planning, Philip Sithole said the festival was not only about music;  it had innovative components that included tech and business showcases for property, wellness, arts, crafts, fashion, food and travel. Line-up “Through Essence, we want to promote passion for people who are in culture and business and we want to 
talk about economic empowerment.” The confirmed line-up in-
cludes local hip-hop star Nasty C, Joyous Celebration and finalists of the Durban talent show Gospel ID. Media personality Somizi Mhlongo, Bishop TD Jakes and Reverend Al Sharpton are also expected. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
