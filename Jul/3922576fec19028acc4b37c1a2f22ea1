The sitting will hear testimonies from witnesses connected to the notorious Glebelands Hostel. “Despite nearly three times the number of people killed at Marikana - the biggest blot on our country’s democracy since 1994 - Glebelands has to date remained a national blindspot,” one of the people who will become a witness said on Thursday. When the commission was announced by KZN Premier Willies Mchunu last October, he said that there had been 20 political killings in the province. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said in May that the number had risen to 33 since January 2016. “But as of yesterday, 89 people have died since March 13, 2014, as a result of government’s failure to arrest and convict politically connected hitmen operating in and from Glebelands hostel. “At least 14 of those killed were political leaders, murdered both locally, in and around Durban and on the KZN South Coast. A further six murders remain unconfirmed, but are suspected to have been carried out by Glebelands killers,” the source said. The hearings will start on Monday at the KZN Department of Public Works, 455a King Cetshwayo Road (Jan Smuts Highway), Mayville. Daily News
