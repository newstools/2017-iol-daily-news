DURBAN - Having problems with eThekwini Municipality’s revenue billing service, here’s what you need to do. “We deal with an excess of a million bills per month,” said Peet du Plessis, the Head of Revenue Management. “The few that have deemed to be inaccurate could be as a result of meter reading challenges and in some instances, human error during the process of capturing readings,” said du Plessis. “Customers must check the reading on the actual meter against the reading on the bill or check the estimated charges and consumption according to the previous bill. There is also a possibility of a water leak if the water consumption is high and customers can conduct tests on their meters,” he continued. Meanwhile, the rates rebate criteria for pensioners has been amended by the City. It has been revised and capped at R2 million with regards to property value, and the rebate was applicable as of 1 July 2017. “There was an omission of certain rebates in the month of July 2017 as result of the delays in processing and this will be corrected in the month of August 2017 by allowing two rebates on the accounts where it occurred,” he said. First time rebates applicants can download a rates rebate form from www.durban.gov.za. However, pensioners who already receive a rebate need to submit a renewal form by 30 April every year. Moreover, customers in arrears can approach the Municipality for a payment agreement to be reached. Due to changes in property value and the recent valuation phase, customers must note that their bills may be affected by the fluctuation in property value.
