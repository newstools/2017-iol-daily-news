With only one week before the Isolezwe Newspaper’s Ingqwele KaMaskandi Music Festival, fans are encouraged to make their  vote count for their favourite musician. “It’s all systems go for Isolezwe’s biggest maskandi festival, which is expected to draw more than 10000 fans from across the country,” said Isolezwe editor Slindile Khanyile on Thursday. “The festival is one of Independent Media and Isolezwe’s long list of events, part of a bigger vision of interacting with our readers to show our appreciation.” Independent Media will be hosting an event of this nature for the first time as a fully fledged events division. Khanyile said Isolezwe readers were fully involved in the nomination process. They were asked to vote for a maskandi musician of their choice from a list of 30 top artists. Khanyile said the response had been amazing and had exceeded their expectations. “We received more than 300000 votes in a period of three months. The response was overwhelming.” She said events, which were hosted in the build up to the main event at many of the country’s hostels, had given them the assurance that the festival would be a success. During the activation events, they managed to discover some up and coming talent to warm up the crowd before the main performances. Readers can vote from the list of top 10 shortlisted artists who will battle it out to be crowned Ingqwele kaMaskandi at the Centrum Park, outside the Workshop in Durban. Khanyile said the festival also encourages readers and fans to have responsible fun and peace at maskandi festivals. The nominees are: Amageza Amahle. Igcokama Elisha, Khuzani, Bahubhe, Qhoshangokwenzakwakhe, Mroza Fakude, Osaziwayo, Imfezemnyama, Indodakazi Yentandane and Mjikijelwa. The winner is expected to walk away with a R20 000 cash price, a R10 000 Shoprite voucher and a cow. Tickets are R80 and are on sale at Computicket. Daily News
