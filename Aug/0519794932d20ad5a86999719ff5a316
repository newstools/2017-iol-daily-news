Durban - A rapist who terrorised women in Bergville, Ematsheni, Roosboom and Ladysmith was handed ten life sentences and 202 years in prison at the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Thokozani Joseph Kubheka (34) was accused of 34 counts which included 16 counts of rape, nine counts of housebreaking, seven counts of robbery with aggravated circumstances as well as two of kidnapping. Captain Nqobile Gwala said Kubheka would do his research on places in the above mentioned areas which only had women in the houses. He would then break in during the night and early hours of the morning. Once he had gained entry, he would threaten the women with a firearm, rape them and the rob them. In most instances, Kubheka could not be identified by the women. From 2009 until his capture early this year, Kubheka terrorised communities. “A link investigator from the Ladysmith Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit  (FCS) arrested the accused after his DNA profile linked him to the crimes. He was sentenced to ten life imprisonment for rape, 105 years for robbery, 72 years’ for housebreaking and theft and ten years for kidnapping,” said Gwala. Daily News
