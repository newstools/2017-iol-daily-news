DURBAN -Â The school pupil who assaulted a female pupil at school was granted R1500 bail in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court. Lindokuhle Dube (19) made his first appearance on Monday. He is facing a charge of assault. Last week, a video of the assault went viral on social media. The school was identified as Siyathuthuka Secondary School in Inanda. In the video, Dube is seen slapping and kicking a 18-year old girl. Both pupils were wearing full school uniforms and the video was captured by a classmate. An investigation by the Department of Education revealed that the assault took place in November last year. A charge was opened at the Inanda police station and Dube was handed over to police by his father at the weekend. As part of his bail conditions, Dube is barred from interfering with the complainant directly or indirectly. The matter was adjourned for September 14 for further investigation.
