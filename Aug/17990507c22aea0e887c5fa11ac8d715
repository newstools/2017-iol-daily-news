THE South African Communist Party (SACP) has again called for an official inquest into the assassination of its erstwhile leader Chris Hani. The request came after the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein, upheld a decision by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha to deny Hani's killer, Janusz Walus, parole because victim impact assessments were not considered when the parole board recommended his release. "The SACP stands for the truth. We remain firm that there must be full disclosure of the truth and circumstances surrounding Hani's assassination," a statement said. "Walus has the duty to co-operate in this regard. We reiterate that the state must open an official inquest into the whole truth behind Hani's killing." The SCA judgment took issue with the victim impact assessment not being considered. The SACP said this was a vindication of their position. "The Supreme Court of Appeals' ruling has confirmed what we have said from the outset after Judge Janse Van Nieuwenhuizen granted Walus parole. With due respect Judge Janse Van Nieuwenhuizen was unfair and did not want to listen to the SACP and Hani family pleas to take into account victim impact statements." Masutha was given 90 days to make a decision. Walus was sentenced to death for the murder of Hani in the driveway of his Boksburg, Gauteng, home on April 10, 1993. His sentence was commuted to life after the abolition of the death penalty. Last year, the home affairs department said if Walus is released on parole he would be stripped of his South African citizenship and deported back to Poland. Walusâ€™ co-conspirator, Clive Derby-Lewis, who instigated the assassination and provided the gun used in the shooting, was released on bail in 2015. He died of cancer last year.
