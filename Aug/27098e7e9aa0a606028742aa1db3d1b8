DURBAN - Former Glenwood High School headmaster Trevor Kershaw’s trial was due to get underway in the Durban Commercials Crimes Court on Wednesday. Kershaw is accused of making false claims whilst at the helm of the school amounting to R5.2 million. He served as principal of the school from 1999 to December 2015. Through investigations, it was revealed that Kershaw had submitted 1 624 transactions for refunds. Among these transactions, he had allegedly claimed R971 500 payable to himself and another related party through 107 “home made” invoices. The complainants in this case are the school its governing body and the Gibson House Boarding Establishment. While the school’s boarding house operates as its own legal entity, with its own bank account, their finances are entwined with the school's and managed by the same individuals. Kershaw’s legal team, headed by attorney Carl van der Merwe, stated that they had received evidence by way of a document storage device only last week. Senior advocate Gideon Scheltema argued that both he and Van der Merwe were not in the province when the evidence was made available to them. He further said they needed time to view the information on the device and would probably need an expert to assist them to better understand the information. The matter resumes in the Commercial Crimes Court tomorrow.  In the main fraud count, it is alleged that Kershaw caused prejudice or potential prejudice to the complainants and/or their employees in the amount of about R370 000 over a 37-month period. The alternative to this fraud count is theft, in that during August 2012, Kershaw intentionally stole about R370 000 and/or a Jeep Patriot of the same value. Daily News
