Maccaferri chief executive Adriano Gilli was moved by the needs of the pupils at the school and revamped its toilets, repainted the school building and spruced up the kitchen. The school is based at the King Dinuzulu Hospital in Asherville and caters for the education needs of children hospitalised owing to illnesses including tuberculosis, spinal problems and orthopaedic-related sickness. In 2015, Maccaferri started the Flying Teacher Project at the school and teacher Patsy Govender visits the pupils in the hospital to conduct lessons. Principal Vani Singh said Govenderâ€™s lessons included reading, maths and a language programme, as well as a mobile library initiative. Singh said they were grateful to Isado and Maccaferri for their efforts. Daily News
