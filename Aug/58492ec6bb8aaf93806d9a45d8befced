Johannesburg - Gender Links has called for the immediate resignation of Higher Education and Training Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana after his assault on a woman at a Johannesburg night club. It has also expressed disappointment at the outcome of Tuesday night's motion of no confidence vote, but saluted Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete for deciding on a secret ballot the previous day. “It is appalling that ministers believe they can behave in this way and still remain in office,” said Gender Links Chief Executive Officer Colleen Lowe Morna. “If Manana does not have the decency to resign, he should be fired. This is just one example of how Zuma is failing to walk the talk on all that our democracy promises us.”
 
"As there are 151 opposition MPs in parliament, we salute the at least 26 members of the ruling African National Congress who voted with their conscience." Gender Links declared that Zuma is not fit for office 'based on his gender politics'. "As we celebrate Women’s Day in 2017, we acknowledge the developments in the political arena with the announcement of three women politicians joining the African National Congress (ANC) leadership race." The three abovementioned women are Lindiwe Sisulu, Baleka Mbete and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
 
Gender Links has also saluted the ruling party for having consistently heeded the targets set by the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development for achieving 50% in all areas of decision-making. 
 
On 17 August 2017, Gender Links will be launching the SADC Gender Protocol Barometer that tracks the implementation and progress made in achieving targets of the Protocol. IOL
