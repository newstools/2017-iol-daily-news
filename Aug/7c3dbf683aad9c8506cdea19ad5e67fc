Durban - Gale force winds have toppled the dome of the West Street Mosque as bouts of heavy rain and cold dominated the province on Friday. Trustee at the nearby Grey Street Mosque, AV Mohammed said this afternoon that repairs should be undertaken quickly. “The trustees at the West Street Mosque are very community minded and I am sure the damage will be restored as soon as possible,” said Mohammed. The West Street Mosque is over 100 years old, being built four years after the Grey Street Mosque which was built in 1880. In 1903 it was extended to include an enlarged prayer area, a madressa, shops, residences and a two-storey minaret. The building was overhauled in the 1980s. The SA Weather Service have said that the high winds should start decreasing by Saturday, although it would remain cold over the weekend, with a maximum temperature of 19 degrees forecast for Durban on Saturday.
