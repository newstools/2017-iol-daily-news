DURBAN - Mthandeni Dlungwane, MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal and Sibusiso Gumbi, the Head of the provincial Department of Transport, will attend the mass funeral of the six children - five of them pupils - who died in a horrific crash which involved two minibus taxis in Dalton. The crash occurred along R614 Mount Elias Road near Fawn Leas under the uMshwathi Local Municipality last Friday. One of the taxis was carrying pupils from Matatane Cool Air Secondary School and other passengers, while the other taxi only had the driver and his taxi conductor. It is alleged that the taxi drivers were playing a game called “chicken” when the crash happened. After the crash, one of the taxis caught alight. Five pupils from one of the taxis and the driver’s taxi conductor died on scene while the other passengers were transported to Greys and Appelsbosch Hospital with severe injuries. “At approximately 5pm, paramedics from ER24 and other services arrived on the scene where they found one of the taxis well alight. Another taxi was found ripped apart. Several of the occupants were ejected during the crash. Sadly, children believed to be between 13 and 15 years old, suffered fatal injuries,” said Werner Vermaak, ER24 Spokesperson. Deceased
