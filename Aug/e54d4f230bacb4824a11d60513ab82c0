DURBAN - Parents with children attending Assegai Primary School in Wentworth, south of Durban shut the school down after they were informed by the Department of Education that Sharon Ndlovu who was recently appointed as principal will begin her duties on Friday. Friday's protests was not the first time parents demonstrated. The parents had embarked on a placard demonstration outside the school and at the department's offices last month calling for the department to reverse their decision to appoint Ndlovu. They are angry that the deputy principal, Odette Abrahams, who has been at the school for the past 24 years was overlooked for the job despite being more qualified. The department launched an investigation into the parents claims and on Thursday sent a letter to the school's governing board chairperson, Andre de Bruin, confirming the appointment of Ndlovu. "However, if those affected are not satisfied, they should lodge an appeal with the office of the MEC but in the meantime, the new principal will continue with her duties," the letter stated. In response, some parents and members of the community shutdown the school.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

WATCH: Assegai School shutdown A crowd stood outside the school holding placards with slogans. One of the slogans reading, "Hoot in favour of Mrs Abrahams". However, pupils going on a leadership camp were not affected but the rest of the learners were instructed to remain at home as the school gates were locked. Those at the protest reiterated that it was not about race, arguing that Abrahams should have got the job because she "understood the parents, the learners and the community of Wentworth". The parents vowed to keep the school shut until the department reverses their decision to appoint Ndlovu. Daily News
