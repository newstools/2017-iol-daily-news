This was disclosed in the Durban Commercial Crime Court on Monday at the appearance of Mohammed Ebrahim. Prosecutor Nolwazi Letsholo said the investigating officer had received a message last week from an unknown number. She said they would contact the service provider to track down the sender. No details of the message were given. Ebrahim’s advocate, Shane Matthews, on instruction from Devan Moodley, said they agreed that the bail application be postponed so the matter could be investigated. During proceedings, Matthews objected to the State sending doctors to assess Ebrahim while he was in custody. He said this should be done with the permission of the defence’s lawyers. Matthews said the doctors used by the State had previously found in favour of the Road Accident Fund. Letsholo agreed to consult the defence before assessing Ebrahim. Magistrate Judy Naidoo postponed the bail application to Friday. The former Mountain Rise policeman was arrested two weekends ago for allegedly defrauding the RAF of more than R6.1m, the result of a sting operation. The state alleges that Ebrahim was not involved in an accident that involved his son, Billal, in 2002 and did not receive any injuries, meaning he was not entitled to fund money. Ebrahim was remanded in custody. Daily News
