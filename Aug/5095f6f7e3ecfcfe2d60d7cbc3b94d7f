The mall is already 80% let, with some big-name global brands, and Reddy and his team are about to tie up yet another international brand, he said. It’s too soon to say who the international fashion icon was who would be launching the mall, he said. The entire Oceans uMhlanga development - residential, the mall and the five-star Radisson Blu Hotel - is on track. Construction has started and the mall will be finished first in Easter 2019, he said. Reddy was speaking in the wake of his Edison brand receiving two prestigious awards on the same night. He received the 2017 Standard Bank KZN Top Business Award for business personality of the year, while in Johannesburg, the Edison Property Group, a division of Edison Corporation, was recognised by the South African Institute of Black Property Practitioners for being the “most empowered property development company in South Africa.” Oceans uMhlanga is one of the property group’s flagship projects. Such is the demand for apartments in the project, that another 60 have recently been launched in two additional storeys, with 30% snapped up within 10 days. The earthworks at another of Reddy’s development projects, the KwaDukuza Mall, has started ,and the project is already 90% let, with 80% being national stores. It is also on track to be finished in July next year. Daily News
