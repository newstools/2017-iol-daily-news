Durban - Durban Mayor, Zandile Gumede said the city needed divine intervention over the cannibalism case rocking Estcourt and the spate of killings around the province. Opening the city's executive committee meeting on Wednesday she said the city needed to pray as people, especially women were being killed. “We need more and more prayers as a province. I’m told that in Inanda a lady went missing and was later found with both her eyes gouged out. Also, this thing of cannibalism is disturbing. We don’t know what’s going on so prayers are needed in the province. There has also been a media report that a man had bitten a woman and she turned and behaved like a man so that is why we need prayers,” Gumede said. In one of her opening remarks, Gumede mentioned that a team of officials from human settlement were working on finding a solution to the Howell Road eviction issue.
She highlighted that the units from where the people were evicted were not administered by the city. “Those are administered by a private entity, First Metro Housing but we are working with all concerned to find a solution. I have erected a marquee in the area so that those people are not loitering, and because we are a caring city,” she said.
