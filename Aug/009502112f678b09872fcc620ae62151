The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, on Thursday granted these parties leave to appeal to the SCA following last month’s ruling, mostly in favour of the media regarding revealing the identities of children after they had turned 18. The court found that the law protected the identities of child victims, witnesses and offenders. However, it also found such protection did not extend to a child once he or she had turned 18. The CCL, Zephany, Childline, Nicro and Media Monitoring Africa appealed against the refusal to extend the protection beyond 18 years. This issue first arose when some media outlets threatened to reveal the identity of Zephany once she turned 18. The media outlets argued that the protection a child enjoyed as a matter of law would disappear as soon as a child turned 18 - this left Zephany exposed to having her real identity made known. The CCL earlier obtained an urgent court order, on behalf of Zephany, which protected her identity after she had turned 18. This order will remain in place pending the final word being spoken by the courts on the issue. Judge Wendy Hughes said, in her judgment handed down last month, that it was a constitutional duty of society and the courts to protect the rights of children. She said: “I am of the view that there cannot be open-ended protection in favour of children, even into adulthood. “This, in my view, would violate the rights of other parties and other rights of the children themselves when they are adults.” The CCL wanted to turn to the SCA on the basis that child victims, offenders and witnesses would suffer irrevocable harm. The SCA hearing date will be determined at a later stage. Daily News
