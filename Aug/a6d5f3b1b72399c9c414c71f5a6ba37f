DURBAN - Learning was again disrupted at George Campbell School of Technology on Monday. This follows an almost three-week long protest at the school after claims of racism and assault surfaced at the school. A pupil, believed to be the instigator of the protests, was suspended on Monday. The pupil attended school this morning and was asked to leave. According to a source, pupils threw eggs at the deputy principal and opened gas bottles at the school's new wing. A group of Black Land First members joined the protest on Monday. Members chanted and jeered staff outside the school. For now, there remains a heavy police presence at the school. Daily News
