DURBAN - Two people were killed on Nandi Drive in Durban following a police shootout with six armed men believed to be part of a cash-in-transit syndicate. The men were driving a white Mercedes Benz and were intercepted by police on Nandi Drive. Two of the six were killed, one was arrested, while the other three men escaped into a nearby bush. The getaway vehicle and a police vehicle crashed into a privately owned car leaving a number of people injured. The Northglen News quoted Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security, who said the suspects were still at large. “Just after 11.30am Rescue Care Paramedics responded a call, where three badly damaged vehicles were found strewn across the highway. One lady was entrapped in the wreckage and the Durban Fire Department had to use the Jaws of Life to free her whilst Advanced Life Support Paramedics stabilised her in the vehicle. A further four people sustained various injuries as a result of gunshot wounds and the accident. All of the injured were stabilised on the scene before being transported to various Durban hospitals,” said Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care. Meanwhile the southbound carriageway was closed to traffic. As a result traffic was backed up all the way to uMhlanga. Motorists were urged to avoid the freeway. Daily News
