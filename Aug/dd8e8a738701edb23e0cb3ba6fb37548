KWAITO artist Mixon Tholo, popularly known as "Tsekeleke" has succumbed to diabetes. The larger than life Tsekeleke was diagnosed with diabetes several years ago and advised his leg would have to be amputated to stop the progression of the disease, but at the time he said he could not accept his fate. At the time he said: “I would rather die than have my leg amputated. I have faith and belief that God will answer my prayers.” The "Fatty Boom Boom" singer passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Vosloorus hospital in Ekurhuleni. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa tweeted: "We send our sincere condolences to the family and friends of a sensational avant-garde of Kwaito, Tsekeleke, who has sadly passed on."
