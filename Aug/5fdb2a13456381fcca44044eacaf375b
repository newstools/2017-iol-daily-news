DURBAN - Twenty people were left injured after a five vehicle pile-up on the N3, Durban bound, before Pavilion on Friday morning. “Rescue Care Paramedics arrived on the scene to find total chaos. A truck, a taxi and three cars had collided obstructing three of the four lanes of the national freeway. A total of twenty people were treated on the scene with injuries ranging from minor to moderate before being transported to various Durban Hospitals for the further care that they required. Traffic was severely affected on both carriageways due to the accident,” said Ceron Lennox, Rescue Care Operations Manager. Traffic is backlogged on both sides of the freeway due to rubbernecking, said Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care Operations Manager. The cause of the collision was unknown but police were on scene and are investigating further. Paramedics have had a very busy Friday morning as they have responded to three vehicle incidents in between 6.30am and 9.30am, which have left one dead and thirty-five injured in KwaZulu-Natal.
