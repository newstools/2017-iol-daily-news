Durban - An R4 rifle with 61 live rounds of ammunition and three magazines were seized by the Glebelands Hostel Task Team at a home in Folweni. On Wednesday morning, police officers of the Glebelands Hostel Task Team conducted an intelligence driven operation at Ekukhanyeni Reserve in Folweni following investigations done at the hostel. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner said a 27-year-old man was arrested for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. “This arrest and seizure of an illegal firearm is testimony to the fact that SAPS members deployed at Glebelands Hostel are determined to removing unlicensed firearms used in hostel killings. We will continue with such operations to bring peace and stability at the hostel. The fact that people have volunteered to be placed on the witness protection program also bodes well for investigations that are currently underway,” said Langa. The firearm will undergo ballistic tests to check if it was used in any of the murders committed at Glebelands hostel or other crimes in South Africa. The man will also be profiled to establish if he was involved in any of the murders committed in uMlazi and surrounding areas. He will be and will appear in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court soon.
