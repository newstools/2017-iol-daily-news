On whether South Africa could do more for disadvantaged women, she said there’s always more to be done by bringing awareness to the actual campaign and having more people join the initiative to create change.  “I think government will take note  and will help us in our campaign. There are doing more initiatives in schools to help children  to realise their self-worth,” she said.
