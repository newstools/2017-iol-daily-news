Light snow has already fallen over parts of the Drakensberg and other parts of the province. The entire province is recording low temperatures. “Our appeal is to the residents of KZN, particularly in areas prone to heavy snowfalls and flooding, to heed our advice as well as the regular updates from the South African Weather Services when planning all trips that require driving or any other outdoor activities,” said Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube. Her department reassured the public its disaster management teams were on standby to assist with every reported incident relating to poor weather conditions. Members of the public are also encouraged to seek help from their respective municipalities. “We would like to warn snow watchers to stay clear of affected areas as they risk getting trapped in these areas when they become impassable,” said Dube-Ncube. Cogta had already activated its Joint Operation Centres in all districts and all intervener institutions including emergency services, police, health, transport and social development etc. “We also warn communities to be careful not to cause danger with fires as they try to warm themselves,” said Dube-Ncube.
