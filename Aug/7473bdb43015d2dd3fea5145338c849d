The Sook Station hostel in the Udom Suk neighbourhood offers guests pin-striped pyjamas for 700 baht (R278) and a wall with a height chart where they can have their mugshots taken. The nine-room hostel is the first foray into the hospitality industry for Sittichai Chaivoraprug, 55, and his wife, Piyanat Teekavanich, 49, after careers in the technology sector. They were inspired by a shared love of travel and the 1994 prison escape film The Shawshank Redemption, starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The hostel’s design includes black-out doors and windows in two rooms to create the feeling of being in solitary confinement. Showers are located on a caged-in rooftop. For guests who may feel a sense of claustrophobia, seven rooms have a small balcony. Thailand expects to welcome almost 35 million foreign tourists - nearly half the country’s population - this year. Many of them visit or transit through Bangkok, a regional travel hub. Sook Station charges between 790 and 1630 baht a night for the prison-themed experience. “People love it or hate it,” Sittichai said, adding that most bookings have come by word of mouth. Some guests like Yui, a 42-year-old hotel worker, are repeat customers. “I feel it’s a real prison,” Yui said. Now on her third stay, she said the hostel’s style and friendly staff “feels like home”.
