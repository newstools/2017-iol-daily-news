DURBAN - Ravi Pillay, the MEC of Human Settlements and Public Works held a meeting with parties involved in the housing protests and land invasions on Wednesday. While the meeting was taking place, residents from Mariannridge intensified their protest by blocking entrances, threw stones at the police and had knocked down three traffic lights. Although the media were invited, they were not permitted to attend a private meeting held at Mariannhill Police Station. However, Pillay was hopeful that his department will make progress over the issues raised by the protestors. Meanwhile, the Mayor of eThekwini, Zandile Gumede has condemned the increase in land invasions that have been taking place across the City. Speaking at the Executive Committee on Tuesday, Gumede said land invasions are a challenge for the City and she also feels that they are politically driven by opportunists taking advantage of a court interdict which prevents the City from destroying structure of  verified respondents. “We need to find solutions to deal with this matter to ensure it does not stop development in the City. We urge communities to desist from land invasions as this undermines our plans for development. We will continue to look for solutions in dealing with this matter,” Gumede said. Gumede said the deputy mayor, Fawzia Peer will head the issue through the Security and Emergency Services Committee which she chairs. She continued: “We need a report on land invasions so we can deal with this matter decisively. This may include strengthening the Security Management Unit who may need more staff. I trust that our officials will assist and that the Deputy Mayor will overcome this issue that we are faced with.” Gumede said that some of the land in eThekwini belongs to KwaZulu-Natal and that the City can enforce and ensure that the land is guarded. She also said that if any official is implicated in land invasion, they will also be held accountable. Daily News
