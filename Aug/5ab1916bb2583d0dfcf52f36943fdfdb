DURBAN - The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has called on its members and supporters to avoid participating on social media in a way that “compromises the unity of the movement.” Mdumiseni Ntuli, ANC KZN spokesperson, said they understood that members in the National Assembly who voted with opposition parties caused immense pain and disappointment but cautioned members from lashing out on social media. “The position of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal is that the National Executive Committee should act decisively against any member found to have betrayed the position of the ANC. We have noted a list containing names of some of the ANC MPs circulating in social media which we view as an attempt to further deepen divisions in the ANC National Caucus," said Ntuli. He said social media posts had defamed certain ANC MPs without credible evidence to support the claim that R2 billion was used to influence voting in the National Assembly. The ANC in KZN has told one of its members to withdraw and apologise for his social media statements, within 48 hours. Ntuli said, “It is our firm view that during this hour of challenges and difficulties our movement must close rank while acting firm against those furthering divisions. We have faith in the capacity of the office of the Secretary-General, Cde Gwede Mantashe to investigate and discipline all those MPs who betrayed the party line.” He also said the unity and cohesion of the ANC is important therefore it must not be compromised through “unfounded and untested allegations”.
