Seth Sons, now 80, was an investigator stationed at John Vorster Square at the time of Timol’s death 46 years ago, he told the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. Sons, who is now deaf, said he had never met Timol in his life. “I do not know him to this day. I only know him from the newspapers,” Sons told Judge Billy Mothle. Sons was adamant he knew nothing about detainees tortured or assaulted. Several torturing techniques used by the apartheid regime security force at the time were cited to him by counsel for the Timol family, Howard Varney. Sons said he had never heard of “the shock technique”, people dangled by their feet out of windows or detainees punched or kicked. Asked about detainees being deprived of food or being denied going to the toilet, he answered “most certainly not”. Like his former colleagues who testified, Sons also had no knowledge of anyone who was tortured during their time at John Vorster Square. He said he had read about possible torture in the newspapers. This is exactly the same answer given by former security agents Jan Rodrigues and Neville Els. Varney produced affidavits by two detainees during the 1980s, who claimed Sons assaulted them during interrogations. One claimed Sons made him stand naked in the interrogation room. The other claimed he was hit against the head. Sons’s answer was: “I cannot remember.” But he remembered that on October 27, 1971 - the day Timol died - people said someone had fallen out the window.  Sons said he did not ask who had fallen, nor was he interested in seeing the body. Daily News
