Each week, a number of high school pupils around the city battle it out to see who will emerge as the overall winner of the competition. Questions are based on articles that appear in the Daily News in the sections of politics, sport, general news, entertainment and finance. Each round has eight questions and tests pupils’ ability to remember details from the different articles. The quizzes are hosted at Westville Boys’ High School and Varsity College Durban North. In Westville, it was the host team who took top honours, with Hillcrest High School Team 1 coming in second place, and Umlazi Comtech High School clinching third place. In Durban North, Seatides Combined School took first place. Northwood Boys’ Team2 and Danville Girls’ High came in second place, with third place going to Crescent Girls’ High and Crawford College La Lucia. Varsity College’s Jody Taylor said he enjoyed being a part of the quiz. “I think it is fantastic because pupils were actively reading newspapers again and not just engaging on social media. “It is fantastic for us to back the Daily News and also give pupils an opportunity to get together on a Monday afternoon to interact with other schools. The prizes are fantastic and it is a bit of fun for the pupils as well. “I was taken aback by some of the answers, but it just means pupils get to interact with all kinds of news across the news spectrum,” said Taylor. The Daily News High School Quiz is a partnership between the newspaper and Varsity College, the main sponsor. The competition is a pilot project and the final will be held on September 11. The winning school will receive a cash prize of R20000 with a R150000 bursary and floating trophy. Each team member will receive a cash prize of R2000. The runners-up will get R10000 and a certificate. Each team member will receive a prize. Daily News
