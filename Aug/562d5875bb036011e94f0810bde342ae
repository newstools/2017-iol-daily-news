Durban - A local dog was rushed to Westville Veterinary Hospital this afternoon after being kicked in the head by a horse. Blue Security's Andreas Matthios confirmed Meditech paramedics were alerted after the incident where Loki, a male dog, was critically injured after being kicked by a horse. "The team hurried to transfer the dog from the Winston Park vet where it had been stabilised, to the Westville Veterinary Hospital where vets with specialised training in the treatment of head trauma were waiting to render advanced treatment. Details surrounding the incident were not yet available. Last year, paramedics rescued a dog that had been hit in a collision on the N12 in Lenasia, Johannesburg, and in 2015, a dog was saved by paramedics after it was hit by a motorbike on the busy Chris Hani (North Coast) Road, Durban. The dog was given advanced life support. The Independent on Saturday
