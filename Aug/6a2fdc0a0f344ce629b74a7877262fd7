DURBAN - The case against two senior policemen Colonel Rajendran Aiyer and Captain Dhanpal Mundhree has been adjourned to September 14 to allow for a senior prosecutor from the Director of Public Prosecutions office to be made available to proceed with the matter. The two officers were each released on R1000 bail by the Durban Magistrates Court earlier this month on charges of perjury and defeating the ends of justice. The charges relate to a 2013 incident where Aiyer and his girlfriend were allegedly robbed at knifepoint at Blue Lagoon. Aiyer apparently laid a case of robbery and Mundhree investigated the matter and allegedly changed statements in the docket . Aiyer testified against the accused when the case went for trial but the conviction against the alleged robber was set aside and the magistrate in the matter ordered an investigation into Aiyerâ€™s conduct. Mundhree and Aiyer were arrested at their workplace. Aiyer, the former provincial head of the Hawks, was stationed at the KwaZulu-Natal head office in Bram Fisher Road, while Mundree was stationed at Durban Central Police Station. Daily News
