Durban -  Police are yet to make an arrest following the detonation of a parcel bomb at the Post Office in Wentworth. On Wednesday afternoon, a package was delivered for the building. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said the package was addressed to one of the employees at the Post Office. "Upon opening the parcel, the complainant found a cellphone with wires and alerted the police. The Explosives Unit attended the scene and detonated the parcel," said Gwala. She added that a case of contravening with Explosives Act was opened for investigation at Wentworth police. No injuries were reported. This follows another parcel bomb delivery in Stephen Dlamini (Essenwood) Road in May. Three people were seriously injured when the bomb went off. Three members of the Khan family, who were injured when a bomb exploded at their plush Berea home on Friday, are said to still be in the Intensive Care Unit in hospital. Zakaria Khan, his wife, Maseeha, his grandmother, Sara-Bibi Khan, 70, sustained serious injuries when shrapnel from the package hit them on their faces and legs. The package was delivered to their home on just after lunchtime on May 19. It is alleged that the Khans’ father, Saleem, was the target of the “hate crime”. There have been no arrests in both matters. Daily New
