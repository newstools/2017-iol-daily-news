DURBAN - Angry residents from Mariannridge took to the streets on Monday to protest over houses promised in 2012 by then Mayor of eThekwini, James Nxumalo. Residents burnt tyres, wire, metal and wood after they were called to another meeting where they were told about the progress of the houses. On Monday, a representative from the mayorâ€™s office was part of the meeting but residents said they want Zandile Gumede to meet them in person. However, residents said four generations have been living in the same flats built by the apartheid government in 1976. They complained about living in overcrowded spaces and some residents have resorted to building wendy houses in order to free up space in the flats. In addition, the land they were promised by the municipality has been invaded by people coming from the Eastern Cape, who have since built shacks in the area. One of the residents, Monica van Wyhe said the protest was peaceful until the police started shooting them with rubber bullets, releasing tear gas and dragging men out of their homes. The residents replied with a hail storm of rocks at the police. Daily News
