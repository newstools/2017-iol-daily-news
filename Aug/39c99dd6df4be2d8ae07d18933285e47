The plan still has to be approved by the municipality, but if given the nod, the attractions would be displayed in front of South Africa House to thousands of tourists who throng the famous square every day. And a similar promotion is also on the cards for the internationally-famous Edinburgh Festival next year. It is all part of a marketing plan by Durban Tourism to have a presence in the city’s tourism source markets to boost international numbers to Durban. Durban Tourism previously mounted a multi-media marketing global campaign with National Geographic to get the city’s name known around the world. The campaign attracted 500 million viewers. Now, the strategy is to convert that knowledge to having a physical presence in various source markets by mounting marketing “activations” at famous events and locations. “One idea is to create five ‘Durban Days’ at Trafalgar Square,” explained Perry Moodley, Durban Tourism’s outgoing project manager. “But we will have to have travel agents with us to offer packages to people interested in coming to Durban. Airlines will also be given an opportunity to promote the destination,” he said. While most of the R10 million budget will go to such activations, some money will be earmarked to promote Durban in highly-regarded international travel publications. “These adverts are expensive, but you have got to be in them,” Moodley said.
