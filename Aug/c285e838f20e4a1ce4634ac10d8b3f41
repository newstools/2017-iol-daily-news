Titled The African Union Commission Under the Leadership of Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, the book gives a glimpse of the work she was involved in between October 15, 2012 and March 14, 2017, when she handed over the reins to Chadian diplomat, Moussa Faki Mahamat. Written in English and French, the book reflects on several issues and milestones, such as the promotion of Pan Africanism through Agenda 2063, which brought together Africans from all walks of life to share aspirations of the continent they envisage. Speaking at the launch, Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu lauded Dlamini Zuma for her achievements as an anti-apartheid activist, cabinet minister, academic, mother and chairperson of the AU Commission, where her legacy of fighting for the rights and empowerment of women remains a shining example, she said. Zulu said those who had worked with Dlamini Zuma would attest to her demand for high work standards and her life as a servant of the people. From fighting for a smoking ban in public areas to shifting Africa’s focus onto young people and the free movement of people and goods in Africa, Zulu said Dlamini Zuma had more than demonstrated her competencies as a leader. Dr Iqbal Survé, Independent Media executive chairman, who hosted the launch, said it was an insult to refer to Dlamini Zuma as the former wife of President Jacob Zuma, when she had proven qualities of her own.
