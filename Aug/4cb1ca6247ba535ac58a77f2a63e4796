Mahumapelo was speaking during a women’s assembly at the Klerksdorp Auditorium in North West where ANC presidential candidate Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma repeated her call for unity within the ANC and said the party should not be divided over who should succeed Zuma. Mahumapelo said: “On December 18, after lunch, there will be a new president. So I’m preparing you in advance. That president will be a woman and that woman will be Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.” Dlamini Zuma said the ruling party was “rich” in leadership ability and contestation should not be seen as divisions. “I don’t see why that (the nomination of leaders) should be seen as divisive. Of course at the end, one person will be elected. “And the ANC policy is very clear whoever is elected democratically by ANC structures, becomes our leader,” she said during the keynote address. “We are not going to win 
(in the 2019 elections) because we want power. It’s not power, it’s responsibility. “Those in government must remember they are servants of the people. They must earn their salaries,” Dlamini Zuma said. Daily News
