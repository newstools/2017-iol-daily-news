DURBAN - George Campbell School of Technology pupils staged a protest on Thursday claiming that black pupils were being called monkeys. Police were called in to calm the large mob who locked teachers and school management inside the school property while they protested outside. Speaking to the Daily News, pupils said this is the fourth protest that they have conducted this year but still the name calling continues. "Teachers think it is fine to call us monkeys. They act as if they own us and know we cannot defend ourselves within the school property. We have taken out complaints up at School Governing Body level and even spoken to teaching unions but still, no one has called us in to discuss the matter," a pupil said. Another added that when they asked the teacher why they were being called monkeys, the teacher said laughed off the question. "They tell us this is how boys become men," he said. Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education, said the dept wished to distance themselves from any school that may wish to promote racism. "In recent times we have noticed that there seem to be individuals within our schooling system who continue to deliberately ignore our fight against this demon of racism. It is for this reason therefore that we are prepared to take action against any person to be found to have racially victimised our pupils," he said. Mthethwa urged pupils to remain calm and not get tempted to take the law into their own hands. "We are currently attending to the matter through our district office," he said. Daily News
