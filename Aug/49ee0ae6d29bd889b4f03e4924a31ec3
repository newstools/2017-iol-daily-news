Colonel Rajendran Aiyer and Captain Dhanpal Mundhree appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on charges of perjury and defeating the ends of justice. The charges relate to an alleged false statement made in connection with a robbery case in which Aiyer was one of the complainants. According to Moses Dlamini, Ipid spokesperson, they had investigated allegations that a person was falsely implicated in a robbery that Aiyer had reported. In 2013, Aiyer and his girlfriend were apparently robbed at knifepoint at Blue Lagoon. Aiyer had testified when the matter went to trial, but the magistrate called for the police to investigate his conduct. The robbery charges were withdrawn against the accused. Mundhree apparently investigated the robbery and is alleged to have changed statements in the docket. Both men, Dlamini said, were arrested at their workplace on Wednesday. Aiyer, the former provincial head of the Hawks, was stationed at the KwaZulu-Natal head office in Bram Fischer Road, while Mundhree was stationed at Durban Central Police Station. Their attorney, Ahmed Kader, on Wednesday told the court the men had no previous convictions or pending cases, and pointed out that they were policemen. They were each granted R1000 bail on condition they did not communicate or make contact with four senior police officers who are witnesses in the case. They also had to hand over their passports before tomorrow. The case was adjourned until August 23. Aiyer is no stranger to controversy. At one point he was thought to be one of the key witnesses in the trial against officers from the Durban Organised Crime Unit who have been charged in connection with allegedly running a “death squad”.
