DURBAN - The National Interfaith Council of South Africa (NICSA) alongside Amakhosi endabuko (traditional leaders) held a media briefing and a massive prayer to condemn the plan to remove a democratically elected president on Monday morning. Religious and traditional leaders broke out into song outside the Durban city hall after a media briefing took place at the foyer of the hall. Only about 100 people made their way to city hall, which included traditional healers and church members from churches such as 12 Apostles, Nazareth and Zion dressed in their religious attire.

Religious leaders and Amakhosi endabuko at City Hall on Monday against the vote of no confidence. Video by Thobeka Ngema At the media briefing, NICSA and Amakhosi endabuko said that they are against the planned marches and the vote of no confidence against president Jacob Zuma, which they see as a popularity contest by opposition leaders. They feel that they took on the role to help the African National Congress (ANC) defeat the apartheid regime, which then makes it their role to remind South Africans of the past and stand against efforts to destroy democracy. In addition they feel that the attempts made to remove Jacob Zuma is only to confuse the people of South Africa. The groups said their aim to serve God's people with loyalty and protect them from those who want to bring the country into disaster. Daily News
