THE Department ofÂ Correctional Services on Thursday confirmed that former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius had been taken from prison in Pretoria to an outside hospital for a medical examination. The short statement did not specify the details of the medical examination and said Pistorius was expected back at the correctional facility later on Thursday. Late last year Pistorius, who is serving a six-year prison sentence for the 2013 Valentine's Day murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, was moved from the Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria to the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre, also in Pretoria, because it has better facilities for disabled people. Pistorius shot Steenkamp through a closed toilet door in his Pretoria home on February 14, claiming that he mistook her for an intruder. African News Agency (ANA)
