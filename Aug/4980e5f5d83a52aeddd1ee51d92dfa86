The strike entered its fifth day last week after wage negotiations deadlocked and workers embarked on industrial action nationwide. The NHLS’ revised offer includes a  7.3% salary increase, and phased insourcing of support staff. On Tuesday, Nehawu spokesperson Khaya Xaba described the strike as “very successful” in compelling the NHLS to accede to the demands of the union on a number of issues. “The union has taken a decision to suspend the national strike with immediate effect, pending the finalisation of the settlement agreement,” Xaba said. “The decision was taken following the conclusion of an extensive consultation with members on the revised offer tabled by the management of the NHLS last week Friday.” He said Nehawu had urgently asked for a meeting with the NHLS to reach a settlement. Xaba also said his union was still reiterating its call for the NHLS to be brought back into the public service. He said the current funding model of the NHLS would continuously make the institution vulnerable to financial strains, maladministration and corruption. NHLS acting chief executive Shabir Madhi could not be reached last night. Encouraged However, in an earlier statement, the NHLS had said it was encouraged that Nehawu was still considering their revised offer. “The NHLS board appreciates the availability of Nehawu and other unions to continue engaging on finding a resolution to the current strike action. “Nevertheless, it is with concern that it notes the impact the strike action is having on the well-being of South Africans, with the biggest losers being those dependent on the public health service that are unable to afford the luxury of medical aid cover and access to private health care.” Daily News
