The Belgium international arrived at Old Trafford for a reported £75 million  earlier this month after netting 25 league goals for Everton last season. Lukaku got his United league debut off to a flyer against West Ham United at Old Trafford, scoring two gaols in the 4-0 win. When asked if he was in the same bracket as some of Europe’s elite forwards, including Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, he replied: “No, no, no, I’m far from that level. I’m 24 years of age. I can’t say I’m the complete package. I can’t say I’m in my prime. I’m delighted that there is still work to be done. That means I can become even better than I am now.” Lukaku said winning trophies was the most important thing for him and he joined United after learning of manager Jose Mourinho’s rebuilding plan. “It was the conversation I had with the manager that really convinced me the most, the plans and how he wanted to rebuild the club and he wanted me to be part of it,” Lukaku told reporters. “I always wanted to play for a club of this stature. Now I am here I want to take my chance and try to deliver as much as I could for the club. “For me, it’s all about winning and now I’m at a club where winning is the most important thing.” - Reuters
