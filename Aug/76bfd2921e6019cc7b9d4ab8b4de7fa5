Muthambi and a staff delegation from her department and entities are expected to appear before the public service and administration portfolio committee to present the finances for the last quarter of 2016/17 and the first quarter of 2017/18. Their appearance on Tuesday comes in the wake of reports that Muthambi hired 27 of her friends and family as staff without following public service prescripts. The reports have sparked threats from the DA that it would report Muthambi to the joint committee on ethics and members’ interests for investigation. Yesterday, committee chairperson Makhosi Khoza confirmed Muthambi would appear before the committee. “I’m unable to say how the meeting will unfold." The portfolio committee previously showed interest in the matter and even assured it was to investigate the allegations of unfair recruitment processes. Daily News
