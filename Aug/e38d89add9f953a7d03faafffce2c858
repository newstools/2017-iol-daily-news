“It was all good fun and there are no hard feelings,” said Noel Govindan, of La Lucia, who declared Noah’s spellbinding performance “excellent”. Noah, host of the American The Daily Show was in Durban for the day on Sunday and told how during his two-year stay in the US, he had missed a lot of what made up South Africa, including the Indian community. Everything was also now “upside down” and had changed: now it was the white people who were marching, he said. And what had happened to Julius Malema’s stomach, he wondered, before going on to give a perfectly good Jacob Zuma cackle and Donald Trump impression. The show - Trevor Noah - There’s A Gupta On My Stoep - was only supposed to be staged on Sunday night, but organisers sold all 6 000 tickets at the Durban ICC Arena in record time, and decided to put on another show in the afternoon. And what was the reaction? “He is amazing,” raved local actress Maeshni Naicker. “It is thrilling to have local talent back in the country making us laugh at ourselves,” said Scott Langley. “It was brilliant, amazing. He is so funny,” said Juhina Bagwandeen. “The show is fresh and he is always relevant,” added Dinika Biseswar. Daily News
