The animals are doing so well, that they are breeding, and every so often, the excess numbers have to be removed to prevent over-grazing. “But we don’t cull them. “We send them off to where they are needed the most,” said Tristan Dickerson, the conservation manager. The latest live-capture operation involved rounding up 21 wildebeest to send to another private game reserve in Zululand, which is restocking since the end of the severe drought. “We generally do a capture every two years, but we may have to do another before the end of this year,” said Dickerson, who was on hand to guide the wildebeest into a waiting truck. The animals were rounded up by a helicopter pilot and guided into a curtained-off section of the safari park, which narrowed as they ran, until the route led into the open truck. PheZulu boasts zebra, giraffe various types of buck, but no rhino. And the park employs five permanent staff to continue removing the alien plants to open up more land. Daily News
