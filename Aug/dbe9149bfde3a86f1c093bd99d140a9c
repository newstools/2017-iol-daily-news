Durban -Â Omesh Ramnarain, who mowed down two cyclists on the M4 Ruth First Highway last year, is expected to be sentenced in the Durban Magistrates Court next month. Sentencing was expected to proceed on Wednesday however the defense asked for time for Ramnarain to wrap up personal matters. A plea and agreement has been discussed and agreed upon between the state and defense. In February last year, Ramnarian slammed his VW Golf Gti into Richard da Silva (46) and Jaryd Dwyer (36) who were out riding with a group of fellow cyclists. Ramnarian's car veered off the road and hit the two men. Both died at the scene, due to the severity of their injuries. Ramnarian was charged with two counts of culpable homicide, driving under the influence and reckless and negligent driving. At the time, Ramnarian was with three other men in the car. The trio is believed to have gotten out of the car and fled the scene. Daily News
