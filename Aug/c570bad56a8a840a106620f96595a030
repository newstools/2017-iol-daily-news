Durban - Nomusa Dube-Ncube, KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has encouraged young women to take advantage of the opportunities that are aimed at empowering women. Dube-Ncube was addressing hundreds of schoolgirls from Durban on Tuesday. She said the future of South Africa was in their hands and it was essential for them to ensure that the government succeeded in its quest to advance the agenda of radical socio economic transformation.
 
“Many of you are part of the generation that will be responsible for taking our country into the next phase of our democratic dispensation which we now refer to as Radical Economic Transformation. The fact that your parents were denied the opportunities that you enjoy today should serve as an inspiration for you to play your part in combating injustice and to become part of the solution to the challenges faced by your communities,” said Dube-Ncube.
 
She told the schoolgirls that they have access to the best education because of the government. There were women who sacrificed their lives for them to go to the schools they are currently enrolled in. Those schools were previously reserved for only a few and the majority of Africans only received an inferior education. As a means to motivate the girls, Dube-Ncube invited women leaders from various fields to speak to them, such as Dudu Khoza, Ukhozi FM’s radio host and Stella Khumalo, uShaka Marine CEO. Daily News
