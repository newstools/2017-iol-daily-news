Durban - A six-year-old boy has died after drowning during a school trip in KwaZulu-Natal. IPSS Paramedics responded to a call where a six-year-old boy had fallen into a dam. Paul Herbst, IPSS spokesperson said witnesses said eight children were taken around the dam. The children were taken on a raft by a guide from Lucky Linton Gold Mine & Animal Farm in Shakaskraal, Umhlali. Three of the children fell off the raft and into the water. Two of the children were pulled out by the guide that dove into the water to save them, while the third child remained submerged in the water for about 10 minutes. “Despite the efforts of both the witnesses who initiated bystander CPR, and IPSS Advanced Life Support Paramedics, the child was declared dead on scene,” said Herbst. The two children who had fallen into the water were assessed by paramedics and remained in the care of the teaching staff. Daily News
