GARTH April scored 13 points as the Sharks secured a 28-20 bonus-point Currie Cup win over the Blue Bulls at Loftus on Wednesday. For the Sharks, it’s a third win of the season, and one that was based on a composed second-half performance and strong defensive display, while the Bulls have now lost their first game of this campaign. Right from the outset, the Durban-based side looked to be highly motivated for this encounter, with S’bu Nkosi scoring early on when he showed great pace to outstrip the Bulls' defence. Although the hosts did hit back soon after when Burger Odendaal ran a beautiful line to score in the 14th minute, it was the visitors who continued to make their mark in the physical exchanges. As it was, Sharks hooker Franco Marais scored from the back of a driving lineout just before Bulls lock Ruben van Heerden was sent to the sin bin for a cynical trip on Tera Mtembu. Yet, in his absence, the only change on the scoreboard saw goal-kickers Garth April and Tony Jantjies trade penalties as the Sharks took a three-point lead into the break. However, momentum swung firmly in favour of the Sharks when Lukhanyo Am ran a delightful line to score a superb solo try in the 52nd minute, while April and Jantjies then slotted a penalty each as the Sharks held onto a 10-point lead heading into the final quarter. The Bulls looked set to make it a tense finish when Van Heerden went over to score just before the hour mark, but the Sharks re-established a handy eight-point buffer when April darted away to score with just over 10 minutes remaining. From there, the Sharks relied on their impressive defence to close out an important bonus-point win that sees them move to second place on the standings.
