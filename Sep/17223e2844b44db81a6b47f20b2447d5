Durban - A 39-year-old KwaZulu-Natal woman appeared in court this week for the murder of a 22-year-old woman whose body she allegedly dismembered. The woman was charged for murder and appeared in the Ixopo Magistrate's court. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said on September 7, Nomthandazo Dlamini (22) was at her home in the Donnybrook area when she was last seen leaving with a woman. When she had not returned her family became worried and began searching for her. She was reported missing and a search was launched for her. Zwane said on September 10 her severely injured body was found next to the road at Sunrise Forest. “It appeared that she was chopped with a bush knife. Both arms and head were missing. A case of murder was opened at Donnybrook police station for further investigation. Through investigation a suspect was arrested on the same day and took the police to where she left arms. Only one arm was found and the second arm as well as the head are still missing. The suspect was charged accordingly and taken to court,” Zwane said. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, condemned the brutal killing. “It is unbelievable that a woman can allegedly attack and kill another woman in such a cruel manner. Our detectives will thoroughly investigate this case and find out the root cause of such killing,” said Langa. She remains in custody until her bail application on Monday. Daily News
