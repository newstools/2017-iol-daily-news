Durban - A hijacking went wrong when a hijacker accidentally shot his accomplice after forcing the occupants of the car to drive to Cornubia, north of Durban. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said on Tuesday a victim and his passenger had stopped at Palmview robot near Verulam, when they were approached by two armed men. “The suspects allegedly jumped into the vehicle and forced the driver to go to Cornubia area. While driving, it is alleged that one of the suspects fired a shot injuring the passenger. The bullet also hit one of the suspect. Seeing that one of the suspect was injured, they forced the driver to stop at Cornubia and they fled the scene. The injured suspect (30) could not run further and his colleague left him. Community members heard the injured suspect crying and they called the police who arrested him. He was taken to hospital where he later died of his injuries,” said Zwane. According to Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson, “The hijacked bakkie containing R100 000 in cash was recovered abandoned on the roadside next to a housing complex.” Zwane said charges of carjacking and attempted murder were opened at Verulam Police Station.
