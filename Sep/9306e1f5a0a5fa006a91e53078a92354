Durban - Rentals collected by some of the city’s slum landlords could be used to fund terrorist organisations abroad, a city official has said. Eric Apelgren, the head of eThekwini Municipality’s intergovernmental relations department, was addressing the local business community at the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Infrastructure Forum meeting this week. Asked by businesswoman Mildred Mnyakeni what the city was doing about Durban’s bad buildings, Apelgren said that officials were currently conducting an audit on them. There were legal challenges because some privately-owned buildings had been hijacked, he said. There were all sorts of druglords, prostitutes and “a lot of slumlords”. He said there were also a lot of cash transactions and “some was going to finance terrorist organisations abroad”. In a later interview, he said that this was speculation, but pointed out that in some cases there were no proper records of finances. Problems were sub-letting, foreign nationals and facilities not being maintained. “We can’t trace the money. There is no money going into the Receiver of Revenue’s coffers,” he said. “The whole administration of rentals has to be addressed,” he said. Apelgren had earlier been encouraging the gathering to attend the inaugural Home Property Summit and Expo at Durban’s International Convention Centre. The summit, organised by Independent Media Solutions, takes place on September 28 and 29, and the expo is from September29- October 1. Independent Media Solutions had also partnered with the Essence Festival, being staged at the same time, which is expected to attract more than 60000 visitors. Bradley Sparks, of Independent Media Solutions, said that nothing like the summit had been held in KZN before. Real estate was one of the fastest growing industries in the country, he said. Daily News
