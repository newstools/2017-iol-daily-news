Durban - Three bodyguards of a mayor in KwaZulu-Natal were arrested by the Hawks for unlawful possession of four pistols, one rifle and live rounds of ammunition. The three men, aged  29, 39, and 40 are bodyguards for Mandeni Municipality Mayor, Sphesihle Basil Zulu. They were expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The seized firearms will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used in the commission of any crime in the country. The trio are believed to be employed by the same security company as two other guards who were filmed brandishing firearms, including an AK47, and making murderous threats. The video has since gone viral on social media. The trio’s arrests has been hailed by Fikile Mbalula, the national police minister. Mbalula praised the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation better known as the Hawks, the Durban Organised Crime Unit and the National Intervention Unit for their swift work in arresting the men. "The Hawks remain our elite unit that combat, investigate and prevent serious organized crimes, serious commercial crimes and serious corruption committed both in public as well as private sector," Mbalula said. Mbalula said he has engaged with Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) who are the custodian of security companies in our country. “Surely we cannot have security companies who have employees who are the law unto themselves. I need answers from PSIRA on what action they will take against this security company. People must understand that guns have caused many heartache in many families and brandishing of guns cannot be tolerated, I sincerely hope that people will desist showing off their guns and endangering society," Mbalula said.
