The event last weekend in Modimolle in Limpopo drew dwarfs from around the country and was an opportunity to share experiences, and discuss challenges and ways to overcome them. Bernadine Coetzee, 19, won the Ms Dwarf competition and hopes to be a clothes designer after finishing school at the end of 2018. Festival organiser Marinda Calitz, who is married to a dwarf, says there is a widespread view that small people can only find work in a circus. She says, however, that people with dwarfism work as dentists, bank managers and truck drivers. “Don’t judge them,” Calitz says. ANA-AP
