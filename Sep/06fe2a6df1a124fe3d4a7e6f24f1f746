The Labour Court in Johannesburg heard that Jimmy Matthews, the former SABC acting chief executive, was responsible for the sacking of eight journalists in July 2016.
Thabani Masuku, acting for former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng argued that his client should not be held personally liable for the wrongful dismissal of the eight journalists in the SABC 8 saga. On May 11, the Labour Court granted the application by trade union Solidarity to add Motsoeneng, along with Simon Tebele, acting head of news, as respondents in Solidarity’s cost order case against the SABC. Masuku referred to Tebele’s affidavit that the journalists were fired under Matthew’s directive. There was also an affidavit by James Aguma, former acting CEO, which cleared Motsoeneng of any wrongdoing, he said. Solidarity and the Broadcast, Electronic Media and Allied Workers Union are asking that the three be held responsible for the SABC 8’s legal action costs against the public broadcaster. The costs order application came after the SABC 8 successfully challenged their dismissal after they had defied Motsoeneng’s instruction not to show violent service delivery protests on SABC platforms. SABC counsel Phillip Mokoena argued it should only be held liable for 10% of the costs. - ANA
