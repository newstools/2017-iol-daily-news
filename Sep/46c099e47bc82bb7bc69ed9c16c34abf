Essence Festival Durban was officially launched today at a press briefing in the city’s ICC. The briefing was attended by Bishop TD Jakes, America politician and activist, Andrew Young, Essence magazine editor in chief Vanessa De Luca and South Africa’s Nomzamo Mbatha. Now in its second year in Durban, Essence Festival is a week long festival that includes musical concerts, business development engagements, youth summits and more, and is regarded as a celebration of black culture, black excellence and development. “Durban is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and last year we had more than 61 000 people attend Essence and we want to build on that foundation. South Africa is the perfect backdrop for cultural exchange because of its diversity and we are very excited for this years festival”, De Luca said. With just 500 tickets still on sale for his concert with local gospel group Joyous Celebration, TD Jakes said he was excited to be preaching in Durban and that people should expect to have fun. “Let me say very transparently that I take my trip here very seriously and always have. I see myself as a man on a mission and when I come to places where I have a rare opportunity to speak, I do a lot of deep thinking, studying and prayer. You can expect me to preach something that is uplifting, but also relevant to the environment. I am not interested at this stage in my life in feel good messages that create temporary euphoria and spiritual enthusiasm just to have our people go home and then be frustrated. I really want to inch our people forward from the platform that God has given me and to take the faith and use it as fuel to energise your dreams”, said TD Jakes.
