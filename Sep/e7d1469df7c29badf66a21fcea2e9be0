Daphne Gengan held her head high as she stepped up to the podium on Friday to receive Warrant Officer Cyril Gengan’s medal, awarded posthumously. “My father would have been so thrilled with this honour,” Gengan said. “As a little girl, I loved watching my father getting ready for work. From ensuring his boots were impeccably polished to putting on his uniform, it was inspiring. “I knew from a young age my father was immensely proud to serve his country.” Her father was one of 40 members of the SANDF honoured for their service to the country on Friday. Danny Gounden was another relative at the ceremony, collecting an award on behalf of his brother, Manny Gounden. Gounden, a naval officer, died after a short illness last year. Danny said it was an honour to receive the award on his brother’s behalf. “I know Manny would have loved to have been here today.” Speaking at the event, Defence Intelligence Chief Lieutenant-General Jeremiah Mduduzi Nyembe said it was a great honour to bestow the medals on members, some of whom had dedicated their lives to serving the country. “A medal parade provides us with a distinct opportunity to recognise and acknowledge members of the SANDF who have rendered long service and good conduct over a period of time. We do this on behalf of the government and general citizenry of South Africa, who may not necessarily be aware of the service of the members being awarded today. “Their years of service collectively amount to over 500 years. These soldiers we have come to bestow honour on here today have sacrificed many freedoms, including the right to life,” said Nyembe. A medal for 50 years of service was awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Ferderick E Greensleeves. Daily News
