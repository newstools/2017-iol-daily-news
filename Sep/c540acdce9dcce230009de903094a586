The two men, a 53-year-old Panamanian and a 53-year old Filipino, died of malaria at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital. Captain Saroor Ali, Samsa’s East Coast regional manager, said a doctor had to examine each crew member before the vessel was allowed to dock at the harbour. “The ship is at Outer Port Limits and will be permitted to berth after a doctor from port boards the vessel for inspection and certifies that it is safe for it to berth,” Ali said. On Thursday two men had to be evacuated from the Agios Fanourios, which was on its way to Durban from Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire. Craig Lambinon, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson, said a call was received on Wednesday requesting urgent patient evacuation off the bulk carrier. According to Ali, no other crewmen had displayed any symptoms; however all would be examined by a 
doctor. Daily News
