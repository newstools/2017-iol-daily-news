MARRIED Sandile Mantsoe is expected to appear in the Johannesburg High Court on Friday, for a pre-trial conference in the murder trial of his girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. Mantsoe allegedly killed Mokoena, burnt her body and buried her in a shallow grave. In August, he briefly appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court and the matter was transferred to the South Gauteng High Court for trial. The 27-year-old father of three has been behind bars for about three months. The forex trader is facing charges of premeditated murder, assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. Mantsoe has denied killing his girlfriend but admits disposing her body. Mokoena was reported missing on April 28 and her photographs circulated on social media. Her body was found the next day in a shallow grave. Her family later reportedly said her body was burnt beyond recognition. On June 30, Mantsoe was denied bail and Magistrate Carlos Labuschagne read into record that Mantsoe was facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice, while handing down his bail judgement. The charges constitute a schedule six criminal offence — which could result in life imprisonment if found guilty. At the time, Labuschagne said that Mantsoe had wrongfully and intentionally burnt the body of Mokoena, cleaned the crime scene and knew his actions would result in her body being burnt beyond recognition. According to Mantsoe, she had previously taken pills and was saved by himself and a security guard, which was why he believed she had committed suicide. African News Agency (ANA)
