Captain Marius Joubert, who continued testifying in the Van Breda family murder trial, wasn’t on the State’s initial witness list. He was called to give evidence at defence advocate Pieter Botha’s request. Joubert said the positions of the accused, Henri, during the events in his bedroom weren’t consistent, and weren’t supported by the bloodstains found on his shorts and socks. Henri was close to his brother, Rudi, and father, Martin, when they were attacked, according to the bloodstains, Joubert testified. He revealed that Martin’s and Rudi’s were both surprise attacks, as Rudi had been in bed, while Martin had been attacked at Rudi’s bed. Joubert said the attack had been initiated on Martin’s right side, and there was a lack of defensive wounds on his hands, forearms and upper front body. He added that Rudi’s body had been moved after the attack. “There was no indication Rudi was mobile after his attack.” Daily News
