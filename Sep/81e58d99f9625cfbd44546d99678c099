“I can assure members of this House that we are in charge of the SA Police Service. There are some rogue elements who at any given time take their chances in relation to crime intelligence,” Mbalula said while responding to questions in the National Assembly. “From Monday onwards, we will be attending to crime intelligence, including special directives to ensure crime intelligence executes its mandate in the fight against crime.” Commenting on allegations from, among others, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa that the country’s intelligence services were being used for political purposes, the minister said he would investigate. “With regard to allegations about political interference, it is the intention of the minister to probe and get to the bottom of this and for those who make such allegations to come forward and provide evidence.” Ramaphosa claimed his personal emails were hacked to try to prove he had numerous extramarital affairs, casting blame on the country’s intelligence services. Mbalula said those working in intelligence who were abusing their positions would be “smoked out”. “Don’t worry about thugs hijacking the state. I will finish them before Christmas I’m coming for them.” ANA
