Durban - With effect from midnight on Tuesday, South African workers will not be able to afford petrol that will increase by 67c/l, with the price of diesel, both 0.05% sulphur and 0.005% sulphur, will increase by 44.00c/l. Andre Venter, spokesperson of the trade union UASA said workers face a financial burden and end up drowning in debt and increasing expenses. “Our economy is weak, demand for credit is low, millions are unemployed, personal taxes are up. South Africa is in a recession,” Venter said. “A fuel price increase of 67 cents a litre will represent a multiple and unaffordable blow to everyday South Africans: It will lead to higher prices of consumer goods and make it even more expensive for workers to get to work and back,” he continued. According to the National Credit Regulator, consumer debt in South Africa stands at R1.71 trillion, with the World Bank naming the country as one of the most indebted countries in the world. Venter said the fuel price increase will add to our burdens which will increase pressure on workers financially and not stimulate the economy. The department had said the main reasons for the increase in fuel price was that the rand depreciated, on average, against the US dollar during the period under review and international prices of petroleum products increased on average during the same time.
