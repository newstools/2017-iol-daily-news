Kaunda said they looked at key safety aspects, such as the brakes. An Eshowe bus crash in 2013 killed nine maidens and two minders, when the  driver lost control of the vehicle. The MEC said this matter was still before the court. He and his department were conducting inspections across the province. Roadblocks were also planned for all routes leading to Nongoma, and drivers’ alcohol levels would be tested. “If you have taken a few drinks, you will not transport our children. You will be immediately arrested,” Kaunda said. Buses found to be overloaded would be forced to remove passengers until the bus met the required limit. Stickers would be placed on buses that met the requirements. Drivers would constantly be checked along the way, said Kaunda. With more than 40000 people expected in Nongoma, Kaunda said the town had small roads, and drivers should be patient with one another. Maidens from around South Africa and neighbouring countries are expected to descend on the town, about 300km north of Durban. The MEC also urged motorists not to try and bribe traffic officers. “Don’t tempt them,” he said. They were working with officers from around the province, including metro police. Kaunda said more than 3100 officers would be deployed on the roads this weekend. Daily News
