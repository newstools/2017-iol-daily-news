They were charged with impersonating law enforcement officers. The men were wearing SANDF and Navy law enforcement uniforms at the funeral. The matter was adjourned until October 5 for further investigation. Luyanda Gezi and Ayanda Mnguni, both 29, of uMlazi, were approached by the police at Wentworth Cemetery where Bhengu was being buried. After failing to produce the proper military identification when they were questioned, they were arrested. Later that Saturday, they were released on bail. Police are investigating where they had sourced these uniforms. Bhengu’s night vigil and funeral brought the township to a standstill. Gezi and Mnguni, friends and community members who publicly echoed support for the 36-year-old gang boss were among the motorcycle riders who escorted Bhengu’s body to the cemetery. The funeral was attended by thousands of people amid a strong police presence. Police were deployed especially for the funeral to ensure law enforcement over the weekend. Three other people were arrested in uMlazi’s V-section on Friday for wheel-spinning a vehicle. Dagga was apparently found inside the car and the occupants, aged between 22 and 27, were arrested. They are expected to appear in the uMlazi Magistrate’s Court soon. Daily News
