Advocate Smanga Sethene spoke to Independent Media on Thursday as he made preparations for the disciplinary hearing against his client, scheduled to be held by the provincial ANC’s disciplinary committee at the party’s office in Durban on Sunday. Sethene said instead of disciplining his client, it was Zuma who should be made to account for disgracing the party through his “corrupt re­lationship” with the Guptas. “Khoza’s contention is a simple one - she says if there is anyone in the history of the ANC who has brought the organisation into disrepute, it is none other than Jacob Zuma,” said Sethene. He added it was hypocritical of the ANC to charge Khoza. In defence of Khoza, Sethene would also question the committee about the alleged ­singling out of Khoza, even though Derek Hanekom, Pravin Gordhan and Bheki Cele have not faced disciplinary charges when their public utterances had the same impact as Khoza’s statements. “At the hearing, Khoza will raise the issue of the Guptas, corruption charges, and she will point out that in the history of the ANC, no one has done more to bring the party into disrepute than the president. “That is Khoza’s contention, and it is supported by evidence,” he said. Sethene also said it was wrong for the PEC to continue with the disciplinary hearing against Khoza as the conference that had elected the PEC had since been nullified by the Pietermaritzburg High Court. The court ruling, delivered on Tuesday by Judge Jerome Mnguni, was in favour of four ANC applicants aligned to former premier and party provincial chairman Senzo Mchunu. The ruling declared that the party had breached its constitution by holding a Pietermaritz­burg ANC provincial conference in 2015 instead of 2016. Chairperson of the provincial disciplinary committee, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, the ANC Women’s League provincial deputy chairperson, said the committee would not discuss the matter through the media.
