He was 23 and studying electrical engineering at the Durban University of Technology. Money was so short he wore the same pair of trousers for five years and “had to trouble my mom for underpants”. He did not even have a bus for his Syavaya Tours destination management company and had to use the transport of other industry players. But all that changed when Mbonambi went on a Tourism KZN incubator programme for emerging businesses and started travelling the world, gaining insight into the hospitality business. Mbonambi bought his first vehicle five years after setting up his company and now, 15years after venturing into the industry, he has a fleet of 40, employs 35 full-time staff, with other drivers and staff called in when necessary. Based in uMhlanga, Mbonambi has offices around the country. He travels to Las Vegas every year to a big trade show, is doing good business in Nigeria and is planning to expand into an SADC country. And earlier this month, Mbonambi received the coveted MEC’s Award from Sihle Zikalala, the MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs, the top honour in the annual provincial Lilizela Tourism Awards, which celebrate excellence and which this year were held in Empangeni. Phindile Makwakwa, the acting chief executive of Tourism KZN and the programme director, told guests the organisation recognised those players who stayed the course because the industry was “difficult to crack”. Mbonambi, who does logistics for big events at conference centres (he handled the transport for the 3500 delegates who attended the big World Routes gathering at the ICC), said the award was a confidence booster and proved he must be doing something right. His advice to other entrepreneurs eyeing the industry was that it was not a quick-cash business, but it was sustainable and there were still big markets to tap into. The national finals of the SA Tourism-run Lilizela Awards will be held at the end of next month. Daily News
