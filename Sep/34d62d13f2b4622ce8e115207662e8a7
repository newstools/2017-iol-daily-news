Durban - The Provincial Department of Health has been instructed by the Select Committee on Social Services to provide a detailed report with clear timelines on when they plan on resolving various challenges within the healthcare system in KwaZulu-Natal. This follows the oversight visit to Addington Hospital and the Cato Manor Community Health Centre. The committee also held a special meeting with Sibongiseni Dhlomo, the MEC of Health in KZN to determine progress in implementing interventions to overcome various challenges in the system. Some of the challenges found within the healthcare system include the high vacancy rate, slow supply chain management turn-around time, infrastructure challenges, lack of equipment, low skills base and under-funding. The provincial health department has been instructed to provide the Committee with a detailed plan, with timelines, on how the above challenges will be overcome within the next month. The committee was shocked when they learnt that due to the staff shortage at Addington Hospital, the mortality rate within the maternity ward was high. “While we acknowledge that the ward at Addington deals with primarily high risk pregnancies, it is unacceptable that the quality of services has been compromised due to inadequate staffing,” said Cathy Dlamini, Chairperson of the Committee. Dlamini said it was unacceptable that medical professionals are subjected to inadequate working conditions in hospitals, which impacts on their ability to deliver quality services. “The lack of proper equipment has led to an exodus of critical skills from the public healthcare service. The doctors remaining are then faced with daunting workload which impact on their morale. This must be remedied with speed,” emphasised Dlamini. The committee has repeated its stand that positions within the healthcare sector must be prioritised and filled urgently. Daily News
