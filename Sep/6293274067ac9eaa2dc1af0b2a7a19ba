They apparently led a group of students mobilising others to embark on a strike on Wednesday over unpaid meal allowances by the National Students Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) since the beginning of the year. More members of the SRC and others who took part in mobilising students were expected to be suspended soon. The three suspended members - Sihle Biyase, Mbuso Sithole and Vela Bawana - held an urgent media briefing on Thursday, where they said they had been served with suspension letters. The suspended students said they were not allowed to enter campus and had consulted their lawyers to represent them in an internal hearing scheduled to take place next week. Sithole said the protest was peaceful and not organised by the SRC, but they had supported the concerned and hungry students. He said although the issue of meal allowances was an NSFAS issue, it directly affected the institution as students could not study on empty stomachs. “Students were fed up. They had not received their meal allowances the whole year and wanted answers,” he said. Sithole said some students began receiving food vouchers back-dated from January as a result of their action. “Some students were paid their meal vouchers late on Thursday. More students are expected to receive their vouchers,” he said. Students receive a total of R1 000 in food vouchers a month; a R700 food voucher to buy groceries at any Shoprite, Checkers or Spar, and a cash voucher of R300.
