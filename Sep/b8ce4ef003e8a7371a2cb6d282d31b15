Durban - The Pietermaritzburg Sexual Offences Court convicted and sentenced 25-year-old Mondli David Ndlovu to life imprisonment for raping an 11-year-old girl last last year. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson said Ndlovu was convicted after the magistrate heard how he had raped the girl. Zwane said on 10 September 2016 at 10pm, the child was at her home at Taylors Halt in Pietermaritzburg when she was approached by Ndlovu who then sent her to his house, not far from her home, to fetch a cellphone charger. “The victim went to his house and could not find the charger. On her way back to her home, she met the accused who was waiting for her along the way. The accused grabbed her and forced her to go with him to his uncle’s house in the area where she was raped. The victim reported the matter to her sister and brother who then reported the matter to Taylors Halt police station. A case of rape was opened and was transferred to Plessislaer Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences for further investigation. The accused was traced and arrested on the same day. He was charged for rape and appeared in court where bail was successfully opposed,” Zwane said. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, welcomed the sentence and said, “The sentence will serve as a warning to other criminals who are thinking of committing such crimes. I also thank the witnesses who were brave enough to give evidence that assisted in convicting the accused.” Daily News
