Durban - In a dramatic twist of events, Omesh Ramnarain, the man accused of killing two cyclists on the M4 last year, has fired his legal team and requested that the matter go to trial. In February last year, Ramnarain allegedly crashed his VW Golf into a group of cyclists out for a morning ride. Jarryd Dwyer and Richard da Silva were hit and died from their injuries. In court on Friday, the mood quickly changed when it was revealed that Ramnarain was unhappy with his lawyers and opted to go to trial.  He was due to be sentenced in the Durban Magistrates Court. The cyclists' families could not contain their emotions as they expressed disappointment at the latest developments. They told reporters that they were simply shocked at Ramnarain's behaviour. The trial date has been set for October. Daily News
