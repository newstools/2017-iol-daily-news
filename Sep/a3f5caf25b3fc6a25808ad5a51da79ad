Durban - Seven people were arrested over the weekend after the night vigil and funeral of  alleged hijacking kingpin, Sandile “Chillies” Bhengu in uMlazi. On Friday at 9pm, as police officers were conducting crime prevention operations and road blocks at V section, they spotted a vehicle spinning its tyres. “Police managed to stop the vehicle and recovered dagga in the vehicle.

On Saturday at 10am, police officers working at M section watched two men in their thirties walking towards the hall. One was wearing a SANDF uniform and the other a navy uniform. “On approaching and interviewing them, it was discovered that they do not work for either of the two law enforcement agencies. They were immediately arrested and both men will also appear in the Umlazi Magistrate's Court for impersonating law enforcement officers,” Mbhele continued. Later in the day, police officers patrolling in J section and surroundings had shots fired at them. Mbhele said, “Police immediately deployed additional vehicles to the area and two men were arrested. They were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. They will be appearing in Umlazi Magistrate's Court for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.” Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner praised police members and other law enforcement agencies for their impressive work in uMlazi and surrounding areas. “We cannot allow criminals to make such serious threats against organs of the state. Over the weekend it was quite clear that those that support criminals are in the minority and most people do not support lawlessness. The presence of law enforcement officers in the area contributed to minimum incidents being reported in Umlazi and law and ordered prevailed,” said Langa. Daily News
