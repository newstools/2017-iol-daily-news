The team walked away with the coveted prize of R20 000 in cash for the school and a R150 000 bursary from Varsity College for one deserving pupil. Each pupil in the team received a cash prize of R2 000. The runners-up Seatides Secondary School lost by a single point and the school received R10000. Kevin Johnson, Varsity College Westville campus senior deputy principal, said he was very proud of the partnership between the two entities. “This quiz allowed pupils to compete on another level, aside from just on the sport’s field. “The project certainly has legs to grow and we look forward to taking it to new heights. “Pupils were given an opportunity to read and learn more about the world around them. “They also got to grow their general knowledge. We also thank the teachers who helped the teams 
and admire their commitment to the pupils,” he said. Aakash Bramdeo, the editor of the Daily News, said he was impressed by the high standard the schools achieved. “From the scores it was clear that all the schools put in a lot of effort, not just in the final round, but right from the start. It was also good knowing that a young, tech-savvy generation found reading a printed newspaper valuable and fun.” The winning team’s captain, Mandy Pitchers, said they were glad to have been a part of the quiz and had not expected to win. “We were extremely excited when we were announced as the winners. We would like to thank the Daily News and Varsity College for the quiz. It was an incredible opportunity that we thoroughly enjoyed,” she said. Crescent Girls’ High emerged as the winners of the social media component where pupils had to get as many likes for a selfie, taken with their team. Each pupil received a cash voucher. Daily News
