Durban - Two drivers were killed when their trucks collided head on, along the R102 in Newark, northern KwaZulu-Natal, on Sunday night Paul Herbst, IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, said one of the trucks veered into the path of the second truck, causing the crash. “The collision happened at about 10.20pm and both drivers were severely entrapped. They both succumbed to their injuries. Rescue teams from the fire department worked for about 45 minutes to free the two men,” said Herbst. The men were declared dead at the scene and the roadway was closed to traffic while clean up operations were underway. It is unclear at this stage if the trucks were fully-laden at the time or what goods were being transported. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokesperson, said police are investigating a case of culpable homicide. Daily News
