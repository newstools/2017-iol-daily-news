Durban - When Mountain Rise Police officers flagged down a motorist to warn him that his car had a flat tyre, they did not expect to arrest Pietermaritzburg’s alleged biggest drug lord. In the early hours of Friday morning, policemen noticed a white Range Rover driving along Orthmann Road. Officers were patrolling and stopped the man in a bid to inform him about the tyre and help him. When the man did stop, police were shocked to find that it was the same man they had been trailing for a long time. A search of the man’s car revealed a stash of more than R200 000 stitched in a backpack and crack cocaine, with an estimated street value of nearly R1 million. Captain Gay Ebrahim, North Cluster police spokesperson, confirmed the arrest.He added that investigations are underway and the man is due in court on Monday. Daily News
