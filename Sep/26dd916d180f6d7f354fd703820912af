Ruchiri Kamboj wondered how trade and tourism could be conducted without direct links, and said she would try to re-establish the air links that once existed. Kamboj, appointed two months ago, was the VIP panellist at a seminar at the Graduate School of Business at the Westville campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal. She told the 300 guests - including bankers, the diplomatic corps and students - that trade between the countries was worth about $10billion (R132bn). India’s investment in South Africa was about $9.5bn, while South Africa’s investment in India was $1bn. Negotiations were under way between the Southern African Customs Union and India to further boost trade, she said. There were 150 Indian companies in South Africa employing 30000 people, most of them South Africans, she said. Making her first visit to Durban since being appointed to her new position, Kamboj said she was “very excited” to come to the city, “as for us Durban is the real South Africa”. Dr Shashank Vikram, the Indian consul-general in Durban, said foreign direct investment in India was $60bn “and we hope to grow it this year”. India had a very young population which stood at 1.25 billion, and unemployment was just 4.9%. Doing business had been simplified for new companies and there were massive billion-dollar opportunities for investors in all sectors. Trade and Investment KZN chief executive Zama Gwala said India ranked fourth among KZN’s top markets for exports, valued at R6.2bn annually. Trade between the countries had grown at least 38% in 10years, but more could be done, he said. Daily News
