“Our officers have been trained so that they can adapt to the new law and systems so that they become its custodians,” said Kaunda. He said this was important because traffic officers needed to be informed when implementing the system so they could not be easily challenged by motorists. This week, the National Assembly passed the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Amendment Bill, which incorporates the demerit system. Loss of life In response to the bill being passed, Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said: “South Africa has been experiencing tremendous loss of life, especially of young people, as well as the continued disregard of road traffic laws.” The department said that 10 364 crashes in 2014 resulted in 12 702 fatalities. In 2015 there were 10 613 crashes and 12 994 fatalities. Last year, 11 676 crashes resulted in 14 071 fatalities. The bill was promulgated in 1998. Transport department spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi said the bill still had to be presented to the National Council of Provinces and signed off by President Jacob Zuma before it came into effect. Mnisi said he did not know how long this process would take because the council might “find problems with it” and it would have to be reworked. He said the Road Traffic Inspectorate was responsible for implementing the demerit system, in terms of which drivers would lose points for offences. Once a person exhausted all their points they would be stripped of their licence and would then have to go through a “rehabilitation” programme. Once they had been through the programme, they would face a tribunal which would decide if they had been rehabilitated or not. If they were found to have learned from their mistakes, they would be able to apply for a learner’s licence and later take a driver’s test. Daily News
