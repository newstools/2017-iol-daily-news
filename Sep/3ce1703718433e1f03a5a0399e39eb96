Hundreds of exhibitors will be displaying products that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, waste minimisation, water conservation, food security and greening concepts that can make your home or office more eco-friendly and also help you save on your water and electricity consumption. Among the exhibitors is Global Solutions, a company that provides water and energy-saving solutions to both domestic and commercial markets throughout South Africa. The company’s products aim to not only save costs but to be environmentally friendly. They have a range of solutions from water filtration and purification that can provide clean drinking water from any water source such as rain water, borehole, tank, reservoir and river to solar driven pumps and household inverters. If you are looking for hydroponics solutions, they have developed a variety of hydroponic systems which produce lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries and much more. Hydroponic systems use minimal water with no water loss due to evaporation or over-irrigation. The hydroponic kits are designed to run on minimal electricity or solar energy and can be installed in any household, school or hospital. But that’s just the tip of the greening iceberg. The Durban University of Technology (DUT) energyDrive bus has promised to be a drawcard at the expo. The energyDrive project is a custom-built truck container which was designed by DUT’s energy technology station known as the KwaZulu-Natal Industrial Energy Efficient Training and Resources Centre. The expo is a one-stop shop for people looking for solutions to living more sustainable lifestyles. Entrance to the expo is free. Daily News
