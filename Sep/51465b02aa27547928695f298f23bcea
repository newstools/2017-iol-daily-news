The ANC is three months away from its elective conference in December, and on Wednesday Ramaphosa said his focus was on his work in government. Several ANC leaders are campaigning for the top job in the party when President Jacob Zuma steps down. Zuma indicated five years ago he would not stand for a third term. However, he will continue his term as president of the country after the December conference. This is despite mounting pressure for him to go. Ramaphosa is vying for the top job with former AU Commission chairperson and ex-cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. Other contenders are Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, Speaker Baleka Mbete, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe and ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize. Ramaphosa supporters have said that allegations of extramarital affairs would not derail his campaign. Addressing the National Council of Provinces on Wednesday, Ramaphosa said he would not come clean on the matter. This followed his announcement in the National Assembly a week ago that he would address the matter in public. EFF MP Tebogo Mokwele raised the matter in the NCOP and asked how the alleged sex scandal would impact on his work as a leader. Ramaphosa said the matter was behind him after ANC leaders and its structures advised him to stop raising it in public. He said he would abide by instructions from his party. Daily News
