She warned that divisions emerge when “we invent things that do not exist and are guided by people, not the constitution, as that leads to factionalism”. “The constitution says all leadership positions are open. That is why after the end of the five-year term, the existing leadership can be contested. “There is no clause in the ANC constitution that says there is a position preserved for the deputy,” she said. Dlamini Zuma, addressing supporters from the Musa Dladla region at a cadres’ forum in Empangeni, was responding to a series of tweets at the weekend by ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, who suggested it was in the best interests of the party for President Jacob Zuma to hand over the reins to his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa. Mantashe’s tweets suggested there would be a crisis if Zuma didn’t hand over to Ramaphosa and ‘when Tambo handed over to Mandela, that was smooth. Mandela handed over to Mbeki. When Mbeki resisted, there was a crisis,” he tweeted. Dlamini Zuma called for unity in the run-up to and after the December elective conference saying, “when we leave that conference, we must be united behind the elected leadership”. ANC KZN provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala said Mantashe’s position in the party meant he could not hold a one-sided view. “The secretary-general says if the ANC does not elect the deputy president, there will be a crisis. We cannot have a SG with a one-sided view; the leadership must be open to listen to all members, even to those with different views.” Zikalala said Dlamini Zuma had a political legacy that was respected by all in the party. “You have to look at the challenges the country and the party is facing. You elect someone who is up to this task.” he said. Daily News
