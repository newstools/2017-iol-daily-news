Durban - Classes at Collingwood Primary School in Wentworth, south of Durban have been suspended after this past weekend's storm ripped through the six classrooms, tearing apart a roof of one of the buildings and causing thousands of rands in damage. Gale force winds were reported across Durban on Saturday. It uprooted trees, knocked down power lines plunging more than 1 000 homes across the city in darkness. Loretta Hughes, chairperson of the Collingwood Primary School  governing body, said she received a message on Saturday that part of the school's roof has collapsed as a result of the gale winds. "I arrived at the school and found Mr C Chan,  the principal, at the school. We looked around but could not stay long because it was still quite windy and there were lots of materials still falling," she said.
