“People often think that travelling is expensive, but it is not costly to have a holiday in KZN,” said Bongani Mthiyane, the general manager at Tourism KZN, (TKZN) who has been involved in the research that will enable locals and visitors to have a great time in the region without breaking the bank. Countless deals have been negotiated and the campaign “Do KZN” - which is inspired by the national domestic campaign “We Do Tourism” - will be built on every month, offering visitors and locals even more deals as TKZN clinches them. The new campaign was launched at a tourism event in Margate last night and comes as the country celebrates Tourism Month and had Tourism Day on Wednesday. Mthiyane explained that the deals can be found on a microsite on TKZN’s website (www.zulu.org.za) and they will be available from Monday. “People are always asking us where they can go and what they can do and what we recommend. “We have come up with ideas for people interested in all sorts of holidays, from adventure type holidays to wildlife, romantic holidays, beach breaks and we have also catered for mountain explorers,” Mthiyane said. “KZN has very diverse offerings,” he said. Deals have been clinched in partnership with Kulula Holidays - part of Comair - and there are also a range of short stay two-and three-night holiday breaks on offer. Meanwhile, TKZN Tourism Month ambassadors DJ Naves and SPHEctacular, the stars of Gagasi FM’s The Kings Drive afternoon show, have been sampling some of the region’s tourist attractions for themselves and telling their listeners about their experiences. They have been out to sea and watched the Natal Sharks Board staff maintain the shark nets, experienced a zip-line during a canopy tour in the Karkloof forest, visited the Mandela capture site at Howick, toured Crocworld at Scottburgh and they will go on a shark dive at Umkomaas on Friday.
