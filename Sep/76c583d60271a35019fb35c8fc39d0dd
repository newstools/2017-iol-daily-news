THE case against convicted drug dealer Radovan Krejcir and four others accused of killing Lebanese national Sam Issa, is expected to continue in the Johannesburg High Court on Friday. The State claims the murder occurred due to a dispute over a R500,000 loan Issa made to Krejcir. Issa was gunned down in Bedfordview in 2013. In an unrelated matter, on August 24, 2015, Krejcir was convicted of attempted murder, kidnapping and dealing in drugs. He was sentenced to 35 years by the Johannesburg High Court. In an unrelated court action, the Czech Republic has started extradition proceedings against him to stand trial for at least four charges of fraud. Krejcir has also claimed the department was “impeding and interfering” with his rights to a fair trial, the right to be visited by his family, the right to legal representation and that the time he had for legal consultation was being unfairly restricted.
