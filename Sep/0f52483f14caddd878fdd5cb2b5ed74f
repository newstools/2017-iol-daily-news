The three were arrested on Friday during a joint operation by the SAPS provincial drug task team and the K9 unit, with the assistance of the ­police’s Crime Intelligence Unit and the Durban metro police drug task team, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said on Sunday. The arrested men, aged between 40 and 45, were expected to appear on charges of dealing in drugs. One of the three would face a further charge of bribery, said Zwane. “After several months of observations and conducting an undercover operation, the police members used their expertise and arrested the first suspect (on Friday) at Pelican Drive, in the Bayview area. He was found in possession of cocaine,” said Zwane. “On further investigation, the suspect was taken to his house in the area where more cocaine as well as suspected powder were found, to the street value of more than R500000. “Two more suspects were arrested in the house.” Release One of the people in the house allegedly attempted to bribe the officers to release the arrested men. She allegedly paid R100 000 in cash to the officers, but they “refused to get involved in any corruption”. They arrested her for bribery and the cash was seized, Zwane said. Acting provincial police commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa commended the police team for the recovery of the drugs and for arresting the alleged drug dealers. “We have a dedicated and committed team willing to work extremely hard in eradicating drugs in our province. Those people who bribe our members, thinking that they will get away with crime, will find themselves in jail,” Langa said. “We appeal to the community to support the team and to provide valuable information about any drug dealers in their areas. “Community members can make use of our Crime Stop number 0860010111 to provide information to the police if they fear for their lives,” he added.
