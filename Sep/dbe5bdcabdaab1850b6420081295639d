During the full council sitting at the Durban Exhibition Centre on Thursday, it was approved that the city will assist with transport, accommodation and catering for about 6000 maidens. The annual event will be held from September 7 to 10. A report tabled at council stated that recognition was given to the positive impact of the Reed Dance in instilling good values in young girls. eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede said the city's support was to ensure maidens were safe and comfortable. Gumede said plans were in place to build a permanent structure to house maidens in KwaNongoma to reduce costs. However, accommodation still had to be provided this year. The city will provide 44 buses at R786 000; two 30mx70m carpets hired for R480 000; meal packs worth R288 000 and accommodation for 15 officials costing R54 000 for three nights. Five officials will be accommodated for four nights for R24 000, among other expenditures. Zwakele Mncwango, the DA leader in the province, said he supported the Reed Dance, but it would be careless to do so “blindly”. He said the amounts paid or to be paid for other services were outrageous. “What kind of carpets are hired for close to half-a-million rand? Are these electrically heated or of some rare quality? "The negative publicity about this important event is caused by politicians who decide to spend public funds for political gain. "One is of the view that this is not about taking care of these young girls, but plain radical looting of public funds,” Mncwango said. IFP council member Mdu Nkosi said it would help to have a council structure that would look into the participation of local girls. Asked if the carpet costs were justifiable, Nkosi said: “Unfortunately there’s nothing we can do now, but what’s important is the welfare of our girls. "This is an annual event, so a permanent structure within the municipality to handle it will prevent doubts about what is spent on what.” Daily News
