Durban - Nhlanhleni Police in the Pomeroy area recovered five bags of dagga with the street value of more than R70 000 and arrested four men. The men were aged between the ages of 30 and 54. They will appear in the Tugela Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and they will face charges of dagga possession. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said at 10.30pm on Monday, police officers were conducting crime prevention duties in the Ilenge area to prevent the smuggling of drugs and illegal firearms. “While performing their duties, they saw a suspicious-looking red Toyota Tazz vehicle with four occupants along the gravel road. The said vehicle was stopped and searched by the members. Five bags full of dagga were found in the vehicle. All four suspects were arrested and charged accordingly,” Zwane said. Major General Bheki Langa, Acting KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, commended the police officials for the work that led to the arrest and recovery of drugs. “The area where dagga was found is known as the area where dagga is easily available and cultivated by criminals and sold to other provinces. Police officers will put more efforts in preventing such transportation of drugs from reaching the youth and those involved be prosecuted,” Langa said. Daily News
