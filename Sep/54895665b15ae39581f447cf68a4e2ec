Devnarain, who is also chairperson of the South African Guild of Actors (Saga), said he believed contracts that the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) had with independent producers and performing artists, needed to be reviewed. The SABC, he said, could play a major role in advancing performing arts in the country, as well as contributing to the economy. “We haven’t even begun to understand the true potential of arts and culture as an actual commodity in this economy,” said Devnarain. He cited international productions being filmed in South Africa, and not a single South African being cast, as a ‘singular embarrassment’. While he conceded he still had much to learn, Devnarain believed the SABC could be brought out of crisis. Rajesh was trending on twitter, as MPs, many of them Isidingo fans, constantly referred to him by his character’s name. When it was time for Mziwamadoda Kalako, ANC MP,  to ask his question, he quipped: “I almost said Rajesh, because Isidingo is my favourite soapie. I only watch South African soapies.” Kalako’s colleague, Mondli Gungubele, also appeared starstruck. “Can I call you Rajesh? You make us late for work sometimes,” Gungubela said to the smiling actor. As the interview ended and Devnarain walked out of the room, one MP could be heard whispering to him: “What happens next on Isidingo?” ANA
