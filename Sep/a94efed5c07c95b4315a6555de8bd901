Durban - The Provincial Organised Crime Unit, National Intervention Unit, Metropolitan Police, K9 Unit and Crime Intelligence swooped on a home in Merebank, south of Durban and arrested a woman dealing in drugs. An assortment of drugs were allegedly found in her possession, police said. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the Provincial Organised Crime Unit members followed information about drug activity around Merebank which led them to a block of flats where observation posts were held. Investigative tactics were used to gather information about the suspected house until they gathered enough to apply for a search warrant. “The members proceeded to the targeted house. A 57-year-old woman was present in the house and she was shown the search warrant. The house was searched in her presence, during the search the team discovered an opening behind the pantry cupboard. When the members went inside the opening and started searching, various drugs were discovered wrapped in plastic bags others were in plastic containers.
