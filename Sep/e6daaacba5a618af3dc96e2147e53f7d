Daryl Mann, owner of Aero Natal, the oldest company based at the airport, said he was surprised that the topic of the airport was back on the city’s agenda. “In our opinion, Virginia Airport is going nowhere. We have not been advised of anything. We were told by the council that the airport was off their agenda and certainly off their priority list,” he said. The airport’s future was thrust into the spotlight at an eThekwini executive committee (Exco) meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Councillor Heinz de Boer said it had been more than a year since the city had engaged with operators at the airport. “The city does not realise how many people fly and land their private planes at the airport. The city further needs to give operators clarity in terms of their future. It is unfair that they are left hanging,” he said. Proposal According to the Exco agenda, there was a proposal from Seaworld Investments Holdings (Pty) Ltd which wants to use the airport site for mixed use. This includes the development of flats, commercial and retail units, and a leisure and educational component. The report states that the bid was assessed by a technical task team from the supply chain management, developmental planning and environmental units, as well as officials of the deputy city manager’s office. Comments were further submitted by National Treasury. The city is considering the bid and will make a decision after recommendations by the economic development investment unit to the bid adjudication committee. Mann’s company has been based at the airport, situated 10km north of Durban, for more than 70 years. “We are comfortable that in 2019 the city will give us another five years. So it is our opinion that we are secure with our tenure for the next few years. This has been going on for the past 40 years, and in the next 40 years the same thing will be happening,” he said.
