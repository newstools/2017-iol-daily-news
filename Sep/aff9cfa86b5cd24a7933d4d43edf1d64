Jakarta, Indonesia - Indonesian officials have more than doubled the size of a no go zone around the Mount Agung volcano on the tourist island of Bali and raised its alert level for the second time in less than a week. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said Monday that people should stay 6 kilometers (3.8 miles) from the crater, and up to 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) away to the north, southeast and south-southwest. It said the exclusion zone must be empty of all community activities. The agency said there has been a continuing increase in seismic activity as well as visual observations of 50-meter (165-foot) -high blasts from the crater. Agung last erupted in 1963, killing 1 100 people. Associated Press
