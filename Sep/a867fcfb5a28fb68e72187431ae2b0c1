Durban - Former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu gave a detailed educational background at  the Moerane Commission of Inquiry on Wednesday. Mchunu was in the company of former agriculture MEC Cyril Xaba, one of the four who were sacked after Mchunu's predecessor, Willies Mchunu took over the premiership in KZN. The rifts with the ANC continued to show after this leadership change, with factions emerging, some in favour of the change while others were left disgruntled.Giving his educational background, Mchunu detailed how he had made enemies while studying at the University of Zululand between 1983 and 1984. "It all started when we went on strike over bad diet at the university. The institution was shut down in 1984 and the next year my name including some of my comrades and fellow students were blacklisted from the institution. I was told that I was not to be accepted in all the university's campuses, including the Umlazi campus. In 1985 I applied with Unisa to complete my studies but a testimonial from the university was required," Mchunu said. He said in the same year (1985) he and other expelled students were called to the university administration block and he was accompanied by his mother. "I was grilled from 8 am to 8pm, with the then administrator of the KZN government, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi present. When I indicated that I intended to complete my studies in education, a mob which was sitting behind me asked in unison as to why was I pursuing education and where was I going to practice? I was told that I was not going to get a testimonial from the university. On my way out I approached someone I knew and told him that I needed the testimonial and the person said the university would only give me a letter which will indicate that Unisa will take me at its own risk. I still have that letter and Unisa indeed took me at their own risk," Mchunu said. The commission continues Daily News
