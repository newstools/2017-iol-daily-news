Durban - The eThekwini municipality warned tourists to be wary when booking for accommodation as criminals use fraudulent information to get personal details of their victims. In a statement, the city said local and international holidaymakers should ensure the details of the establishment, they make reservations at are legitimate. Peter Rose, chairperson of Umhlanga Tourism said the fraudsters get their victims’s details online. “These fraudsters then simply change the bank account details, phone numbers, address and website of the legit establishment without the owner being aware of what is happening. When the visitor arrives at the address, it is found to be non-existent,” Rose said. He said this put the city in a bad light. In its fight against fake accommodation establishments, the city has launched the Durban Tourism Accommodation App which will have details of 732 places which rate from 3 to 5 stars.It will also have the full details of the establishment. The app which is available to all android phones will have shortest route information and emergency numbers should holidaymakers get into trouble. Phillip Sithole, the Acting Deputy City Manager for the Economic Development and Planning Cluster, said the city would ensure all establishments met the city safety and health regulations. “We will visit the establishment with a team comprising of the Health and Business Licencing Units and community tourism organisations. If the establishment is deemed to be unregistered and a health or safety hazard, it may be closed down,” he said. Daily News
