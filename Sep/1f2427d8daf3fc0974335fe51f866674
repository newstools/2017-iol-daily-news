Durban - A man was arrested and a R100 000 recovered following a shoot out in Old Main Road, Ottawa on Tuesday afternoon. It is alleged that two men were parked at an intersection when they were accosted by two armed men who tried to rob them of R100 000. Prem Balram, spokesperson for Reaction Unit SA, said they received a call from a member of the public about the robbery. "One of the men inside the car was shot in the foot and stabbed in the hand. The suspects had a gun and a knife. When the driver refused to hand over his vehicle, a scuffle ensued between the two suspects and the driver.Â During the scuffle the victim was stabbed in the hand. The second suspect fired four shots at the victim. One bullet struck the victim in the foot while a second bullet struck the suspect's accomplice in the abdomen," said Balram. The victim was then forced out of his vehicle before the suspects drove off in the Nissan bakkie. Reaction Officers searched the area and recovered the Nissan bakkie including the R100 000 in cash abandoned on the roadside next to a housing complex. Officers conducted an extensive search of the complex and found the injured suspect hiding outside a flat. The man was bleeding from a single gun shot wound to the abdomen. He was placed under arrest and is currently receiving medical attention for his injury. Balram added that the men had dropped their R100 000 loot whilst fleeing because they were being chased by RUSA officers. Daily News
