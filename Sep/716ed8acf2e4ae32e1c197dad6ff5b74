DURBAN - Two privately owned KwaZulu-Natal emergency services have set a precedent by buying high-performance vehicles to speed up response times.
Both companies, situated on the North Coast, have bought vehicles costing more than a million rand each. IPSS Medical rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said Rapid Response Vehicles responded to emergencies before ambulances and other support units. Power, speed, braking capabilities and safety features are among the reasons they bought three Porsche Cayennes. They can also haul all their rescue and medical equipment. “We respond within the parameters of the Road Traffic Act. Extra torque and speed are required in such units. The SUV can access almost any environment on- or off-road .” Herbst said they also carried heavy, high-angle rescue gear and swift-water rescue equipment. They have bases in Ballito, Verulam, oThongathi, KwaDukuza, Mandeni and Ladysmith. The Porsche Cayenne is a mid-size luxury crossover sports utility vehicle with the average retail price of about R1.3 million. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), a private security company, bought a Ford Mustang GT 500 to keep up with and apprehend hijackers and business robbers that operate between oThongathi and Phoenix. The Mustang is kitted to tackle crimes in progress. The vehicle retails for about R1.5 million , Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said. The car is fitted with a tracking unit to help find stolen vehicles. “The new cars are expected to boost the recovery rate of vehicles stolen and hijacked in KwaZulu-Natal,” Balram said. Daily News
