“We are desperate,” said their leader, Popo Zungu. He said they wanted to meet eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede on Thursday to discuss the issue, but were out of luck because she was elsewhere. Zungu said people were sleeping outside their homes and some of their belongings were damaged beyond repair after the rains that had hit Durban in the past few weeks. More than 50 residents were evicted from their low-income housing project last month. Zungu said their complaints were being ignored and the city did not care about their plight. One resident, Pretty Gumede, said she had not gone to work on Thursday so she could take part in the  protest. “Our clothes are lying outside while the Red Ants (a private security company) stay inside our homes,” she said. “It is so painful. We will keep coming here until they listen to us. We will bring blankets to sleep here if we have to.” The evictions were part of a continuation of a legal feud with First Metro Housing to obtain their title deeds. Residents say they were told they would own the houses after renting them for a  period. Mthunzi Gumede, the mayor’s spokesperson, said they had a team working on the issue. He called for patience, but said there would be no "overnight solution". Daily News
