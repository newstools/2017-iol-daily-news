The second most-populated province sits at 1.8days of GroupO stock. The blood service is calling on donors in KZN to donate blood immediately. This will aid people in life-threatening situations and anyone who needs or relies on blood transfusions to live. Silungile Mlambo, the national marketing manager for the SANBS, said the blood supply was “dangerously low”. “The blood supply is currently at just 1.8 days of Group O stock, meaning less than 200 units of O blood are available around the province,” Mlambo said. A “healthy blood stock” is 500 units of blood a day. “The situation is critical. We are appealing to residents of KwaZulu-Natal - active donors, lapsed donors and potential donors - to stand together right now to bolster the regional blood stock. We thank them, in advance, for pulling together.” “So many people in life-threatening situations require blood. It’s what saves a haemorrhaging mother’s life, so that she can raise and love the baby she has just brought into the world.” To locate your nearest SANBS donor centre in KwaZulu-Natal, visit sanbs.org.za or call 0800 11 90 31.
