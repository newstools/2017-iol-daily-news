This comes as the ANC was preparing to bury its former councillor and ex-secretary-general of the ANC Youth League, Sindiso Magaqa, this weekend. On Thursday, the cabinet condemned the murder of councillors across the country, including KZN and the Eastern Cape. Several councillors have been slain since last year, prior to the local government polls. The cabinet statement came as Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe came under fire in Parliament on ANC infighting threatening to cripple the state. Radebe refused to be drawn into ANC infighting, telling the opposition in the National Council of Provinces to mind their own business. Radebe, ANC head of policy, also would not be drawn on comments by former president Kgalema Motlanthe that the ANC needed to lose the next election to sort itself out. Radebe was answering questions in the NCOP when opposition MPs attacked him and the ANC for bringing its internal battles into state institutions. Radebe also refused to be drawn on the Pietermaritzburg High Court ruling to scrap the outcome of the ANC provincial conference in KZN in 2015. The DA’s Chris Hattingh said the infighting had paralysed government functions as the state was unable to deliver services, and the EFF’s Kagisang Koni said State-owned entities had been restructured to ensure the Guptas benefited from state contracts. Radebe and his Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation had failed to stop the rot in SOEs. Daily News
