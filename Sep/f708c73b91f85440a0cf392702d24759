Omesh Ramnarain is accused of crashing into a group of cyclists who were taking part in a morning ride along the Ruth First Freeway (M4 Northern Freeway) in February last year. Richard da Silva, 46, and Jared Dwyer, 36, died at the scene. Ramnarain is facing two counts of culpable homicide as well as charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, and reckless and negligent driving. The trial was meant to start on Monday, but representations were made about a possible plea and sentence agreement, to which the cyclists’ families agreed in principle. However, the matter was adjourned on Wednesday. Ramnarian’s legal team requested the adjournment until next month, to give him time to sort out his personal affairs. Outside court, the families embraced one another. While a few relatives held back and shouted angry sentiments, Da Silva’s mother, Rosie, and Dwyer’s father, Sandy, hugged Ramnarain’s family. Ramnarain stood close to them for a few minutes before walking off and wiping away tears. Dressed in a black pin-striped suit, he stood a few metres away while the families continued to talk. Speaking to the Daily News, Da Silva’s  partner, Sonya Ferreira, said she just wanted it all to be over. Ferreira and Da Silva were together for 26 years. “The journey thus far has been very emotional for all of us. But we understand that this is bad for all. Richard’s family and I have come to a place where we understand nothing will bring him back,” said Ferreira. She said she believed that Ramnarain was remorseful. Two of Ramnarain’s relatives chatted to Ferreira outside the court. The women, who declined to speak to the Daily News, told Ferreira they empathised with what the cyclists’ families were experiencing. Ferreira said the support they received from the public had been phenomenal. Sandy Dwyer declined to comment. Ramnarain is expected to appear in court on September 15. Daily News
