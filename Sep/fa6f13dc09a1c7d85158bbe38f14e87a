Cosatu provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize said affiliates in various sectors would join the nationwide industrial strike. Unions affiliated to Cosatu include critical industries such as health, education, municipal workers, transport and mining. “Based on the response from our provincial shop steward council, which we use as a mobilisation platform, we anticipate a large turn-out. “The reports from our affiliates on the work they are doing on the ground is promising. We are positive it is going to be a successful campaign.” Mkhize said the twin evils of corruption and job losses had cost workers their jobs and robbed people of much-needed services. “The main challenges we foresee as Cosatu is that if we fail to deal with these issues, we are going to face disinvestment in our country because investors will lose confidence. It is the workers who are going to suffer,” he said. He said the banning of labour brokers, which Cosatu has been calling for, was also on the agenda. Cosatu has already obtained a certificate to strike from the National Economic Development and Labour Council, after the organisation held its central executive committee meeting. The march will start at King Dinuzulu Park and end at the Durban City Hall. Daily News
