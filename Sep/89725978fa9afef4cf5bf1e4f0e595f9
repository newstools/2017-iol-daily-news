Durban - A vehicle occupied by two men in their 30s crashed down an embankment in the early hours of Friday morning. Belinda Catchpole, KwaZulu Private Ambulance area manager said, their paramedics responded to the crash on Seaslopes Road in Margate. The vehicle could have rolled even further down the embankment had vegetation not acted as a barrier to stop the vehicle on its way down. “On their arrival at the scene they found a light motor vehicle had left the road and crashed into a tree down an embankment. Both driver and passenger were still in the vehicle,” Catchpole said. Catchpole said the fire department had to use the Jaws of Life to remove the occupants from the vehicle, which took about 20 minutes. “Both patients sustained multiple fractures. There was not much external bleeding, but they definitely had internal bleeding due to the fractures,” she explained. The men were then stabilised and taken to hospital. Daily News
