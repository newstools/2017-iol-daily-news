Mxoleleni Hopeson Bhani, 23, is standing trial for the murder on the court’s premises on May 18, 2015. He is the only person standing trial. This despite a state witness who was with Ndovela when the murder took place alleging that there were three people seen with him during the shooting. The witness, who cannot be named after testifying in camera, identified Bhani as the one who shot Ndovela dead. A pivotal point in the State’s case is that Ndovela was gunned down because he was the single witness to a murder which took place at Glebelands hostel in February 2015. Durban High Court Acting Judge Fazal Abraham, who began the judgment proceedings on Tuesday, is expected to conclude on Thursday. Abraham would have to decide whether the identification of Bhani was done following the right procedures for an  identification parade. The witness testified that he was with Ndovela when he heard the sound of a gun cocking and then he saw Bhani, who was wearing a red T-shirt and black pants, pointing a gun at Ndovela’s head from behind. He said he saw two other men run towards Ndovela and more gunshots were fired. The other two accused were arrested, but were later released owing to a lack of evidence. The witness claimed that he saw the shooter clearly because he was facing him, and was therefore able to identify him during the ID parade. In his evaluation of evidence, Abraham said: “The evidence before court was that the shooter was close to the witness to see him. The witness’s visibility opportunity was also not challenged,” he said. Daily News
