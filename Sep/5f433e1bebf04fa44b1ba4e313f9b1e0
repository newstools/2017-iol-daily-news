Themba Mthembu, MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development, said on Thursday in Shallcross as he marked World Rabies Day. He said that there had been a decrease from 473 cases in 2007, to 47 recently. “Furthermore, the province had no reported incidents for more than a year prior to the recent reports, meaning we had managed to stay rabies-free for 18 months, the longest period in 40 years,” Mthembu said. The most recent report 
was that of a 2-year-old boy 
who died in Bhamshela last month. The infant had been bitten by the family dog and the mother did not take any action until the child was gravely ill. The death has been one of many in the eThekwini, King Cetshwayo and uMshwathi municipalities. Mthembu attributed the 
department’s success to its 
collaborations with non-governmental organisations and the private sector. To continue the fight against the disease, the department had begun mass vaccination and education campaigns. The department’s efforts would be particularly focused on areas where there have been recent incidents of rabies. Mthembu said they had already set aside funding for the vaccination of 70% of dogs in the province. “Rabies is prevalent in all continents, particularly in Asia and Africa as 95% of all cases reported stem from these 
regions,” he said. Although rabies affected everyone, global statistics showed that males under 15 were the most common victims. “The global phenomenon presents to us the colossal work we have ahead of us to curb the spread of this fatal disease, especially as rabies is a 100% vaccine-preventable disease,” Mthembu said.
