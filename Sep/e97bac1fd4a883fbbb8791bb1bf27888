It was not just the people directly employed in the sector who helped visitors have a memorable holiday, said Sihle Zikalala, the MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs. Ordinary people who helped tourists with directions, who worked at restaurants, taxi drivers and street vendors also played a part. The Tourism Month campaign, “Do KZN”, aims to encourage people of KZN to explore their province. Tourism KZN has joined forces with South African DJs Sphesihle Ngwenya and Lebohang Naves, known as the “Kings of the weekend, DJs Sphe and Naves” to roll out the campaign. They will explore some key tourism attractions around the province during the month to get people to do the same. The MEC will also host the provincial Lilizela Tourism Awards at the uMhlathuze Municipality next Thursday when he will recognise tourism players who continue to deliver excellent service to visitors. In Durban, Tourism Month will start with the Shisa Nyama Festival at Eyadini Lounge in uMlazi on Saturday when more than 5000 people will enjoy local flavours and KZN’s best open-flame chefs will cook side-by-side to determine who makes the best shisa nyama in Durban. Durban Tourism says that other events being celebrated in the city are: the Mrs Universe Pageant at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli ICC on Saturday; the Coca-Cola Bunny Chow Barometer at Blue Lagoon on Sunday; the 18th Jomba Contemporary Dance Experience at UKZN from today until Sunday and the Mercury Wine Week, which starts today at the Greyville Convention Centre.
