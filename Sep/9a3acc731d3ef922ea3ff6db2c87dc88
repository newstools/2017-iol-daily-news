Gumede, regional and league members held a press conference on Wednesday where they vowed to defy protocol and potentially anger the mother body by lodging an appeal against Tuesday’s ruling. The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) wants to appeal against the ruling of judges Piet Koen, Sharmaine Balton and Mahendra Chetty that the 2015 Pietermaritzburg conference, which elected Sihle Zikalala as the provincial chairman against Senzo Mchunu was unlawful. In Durban on Wednesday, Gumede said: “When I was coming here someone told me people are at City Hall to cast me out. “It is not easy. I am still the chairperson of eThekwini, I am still the mayor. I have my regional secretary (Bheki Ntuli) and the (ANC) leagues to make sure that I am the mayor and the chair,” she said. Ntuli said the members of the Regional Executive Committee would launch a probe into the disruptions at City Hall. “It shows that there are people who do not understand how the processes work. They want to remove the mayor just because of the court judgment,” said Ntuli. KZN Youth League chairperson Kwazi Mshengu said the court ruling did not mean that all decisions taken by the PEC led by Zikalala were invalid. “The ruling said ‘The setting aside of a principal act does not inevitably result in the invalidation of subsequent acts’, and in this case, the decision was taken by the PEC of the ANC elected in that conference,” he said, clarifying that all the decisions still stood. KZN Youth League provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said the court case was linked to contestation for the national elective conference. However, Sthembiso Mshengu, one of the four applicants who brought the case against the PEC, rubbished the allegations. “This has dragged on for so long. If it were about the elective conference, we would have tried to speed up the decision. We were tolerant with the court, and we won’t stoop to that level,” he said. Daily News
