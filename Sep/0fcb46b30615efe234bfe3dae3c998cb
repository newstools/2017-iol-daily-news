This follows a complaint sent to the SAPS by a crocodile breeder who suspected that his crocodiles had been captured and killed. Mpumalanga SAPS spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe confirmed that five people were arrested in connection with killing the crocodiles and appeared in the Barberton Magistrate’s Court. The accused - Victor Mhlongo, 44; Linda Mbusha, 27; Sifiso Khoza, 30; Mlungisi Madonsela, 22; and Moses Mnisi, 41 - have been remanded until tomorrow, pending a bail application. Bhembe said: “All five were arrested on the spot when found in possession of crocodile carcasses and charged with the hunting of protected game.” Mbombela SPCA welfare inspector Marcelle Hoffman told the Daily News’ sister newspaper, The Star, that the staff on the farm were distraught. “They look after these breeding animals. “When they (the suspects) were arrested they were found with 
pangas and axes, which is a very cruel way of poaching animals,” said Hoffman. “The crocodiles were found with parts removed and used for muti. We cannot call it traditional medicine because traditional medicine has a herb base,” she said. “The bones, heads and tails were removed and the bodies dumped just outside the farm. “The heads were found on the people who were arrested.” - Daily News Correspondent
