But this weekend, the Sharks gave us something to cheer about when they beat the Blue Bulls to make it into the Currie Cup final. What’s more, given the success of the team this year ensured they topped the log, and that the final will be played in Durban. Win or lose, it is a triumph for our city and our province. There will be economic spin-offs but, the greatest benefit of such an event lies in its ability to bring people together. It is for this reason that the Daily News has embarked on a social media campaign called #FillUpTheSharkTank last night. We want to get behind the men in black and white, and give them the support they need to win the final. It’s been four long years since the Sharks last won the Currie Cup, and seven since they won it at home. This Saturday, one of the survivors of the 2013 winning team, Odwa Ndungane, will take to the field for what will be his final game for the Sharks before he retires. A win this Saturday against Western Province will be a fitting send-off for him and will give the rest of us some much-needed cheer. So, let’s get behind the Sharks and let us #FillUpTheSharkTank.
