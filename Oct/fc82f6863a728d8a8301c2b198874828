Siphosethu’s friend was driving the car at the time of the crash in Botha’s Hill. It was during the trial exams, and as a result Siphosethu did not write two exams. The 17-year-old spent weeks in hospital. He underwent extensive physiotherapy. Through his determination to recover as soon as possible, Siphosethu, still in a neck brace, was among the pupils who wrote maths or maths literacy Paper 2 yesterday at 1688 public schools and 69 independent school centres in KwaZulu-Natal. This year, more female candidates were registered in the province for the exams, with 85299 full-time females, while male candidates numbered 24126. Siphosethu said he was not supposed to be walking, according to his doctor’s instructions, but he took his chances and went back to school. “I am grateful that I survived the accident. All I had to do was to heal quickly and prepare myself for the exams,” he said. Siphosethu believed that if you wanted something, you had to do everything to get it. “I am still in pain, but my exams are important. Writing is not that strenuous, but studying is extremely difficult. I am holding on and pray that I can handle it until the exams end,” he said.  He said on Monday that the maths exam was long, but he did all he could to prepare and was now looking forward to his results. Noluthando Ngobese also felt the paper was long, but said she enjoyed it. “I had prepared well. It was not that difficult, but I am sad that I could not finish it,” she said. Noluthando said she would be disappointed if she scored lower marks than required for pilot studies at a flight school in Pretoria. Boitumelo Oliphant felt she would pass the exam. “I found the Euclidean geometry section to be extremely difficult. I spent too much time on it,” she said. Cebolenkosi Njapha and Sanelisiwe Mabaso also thought the paper was too long, although they had studied hard and were well prepared. They said they would have preferred a shorter paper. Daily News
