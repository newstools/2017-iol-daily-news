“We want clean and flawless examinations,” chief executive officer of Umalusi, Dr Mafu Rakometsi, said during an assessment of the state of readiness of the 2017 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations, to be written by 634 814 full-time candidates at 6 844 venues around South Africa. The examinations will begin on Monday, October 23, with 112 164 of the candidates being from Gauteng. KwaZulu-Natal, with 169 023 pupils, has the highest number. Rakometsi said after the paper leak in Limpopo last year the board was extra vigilant. The board said provinces and centres that had security issues would be revisited to ensure that changes were made. Last year, a Grade 12 maths examination paper was leaked to pupils in Limpopo, before it was written. The year before, a life sciences exam paper was leaked in the same province. “The system is improving and it’s not where it was in the past,” Rakometsi said. This week’s storms in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal had presented an unexpected challenge. “I’ll be issuing a letter to each province requesting them to give information on which examination centres were affected,” Rakometsi said.
