Durban - Premier Willies Mchunu and deputy mayor Fawzia Peer have added their voices to the Daily News’s #FillUpTheSharkTank social media campaign urging the people of the province to unite behind the Sharks. Peer said the Sharks go into Saturday’s final against Western Province with confidence following their semi-final victory. “The Sharks showed a lot of character to win and it was a good effort before the final. The Sharks are a team everyone can get behind,” Peer said. “The economic spin-offs of playing a home game in Durban will be huge for the city. The Daily News’s #FillUpTheSharkTank campaign is an excellent example of how all sectors of our community can work together for a common goal. We encourage everyone to get behind the Sharks and fill the Shark Tank this Saturday,”  she said. Mchunu agreed. “We must remember that the Currie Cup has been missing from the Sharks’ trophy cabinet for almost five years. Through our support, the team stands a chance of turning things around,” he said.  Mchunu said the match slotted perfectly into the province’s social cohesion programme to use sport to unite people across racial lines. “Rugby in particular, as demonstrated during the World Cup in 1995, has the potential to bridge the racial divide. Already last week the people of KwaZulu-Natal rallied behind the Sharks, resulting in the men in black and white beating the Blue Bulls to make it into the Currie Cup final.” Mchunu said three companies that assessed the technical and commercial strength of South Africa, Ireland and France’s Rugby World Cup bids would make a recommendation to the world rugby general council soon. “We are hoping for positive outcomes as KZN is ready to be an excellent host of SA Rugby World Cup 2023,” he said.
