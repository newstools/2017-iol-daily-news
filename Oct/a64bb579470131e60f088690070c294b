City of Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said the carcasses of River and Serabi had been taken to Onderstepoort Veterinary Services for examination. “Police had found pieces of meat with white granules in the veld on October 10 after the lionesses died,” Mashigo said. “The results confirmed that the granules were indeed poison.” Lion tours were immediately suspended after the City of Tshwane announced the death of the two popular lionesses. River was initially discovered in the grounds at around 1.30pm during a tour. She had a bloodied nose. The City said at the time that after River’s body was found staff were prompted to move the remaining lions to a smaller enclosure for their protection. It was then  realised that another tourist drawcard, Serabi, was missing. Serabi’s body was found at 6pm. Mashigo told Independent Media that “the tours are now taking place with the lions in the smaller enclosure. “The visitors use the lion deck to view the lions. “The larger enclosure remains closed and will be open once it is safe - after a good rainfall to wash away small particles of poison.” The conservation and tourist attraction reserve has ­suffered a loss of wildlife in the past due to criminal activities. In July, Ma Koei, a rhino ­believed to be 40 years old, was shot dead in what was ­suspected to be a poaching attempt. Last year, the reserve closed tours to the public when two rhinos, one pregnant, were found killed by suspected poachers.
