DURBAN - No damage was done to Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban after a mischievous behaviour from Kaizer Chiefs supporters following their defeat to Baroka FC this past weekend. Chiefs supporters were enraged by the 2-1 defeat to Bakgaga in an Absa Premiership match. Some fans threw missiles onto the pitch, while others tried to jump the stadium security in their quest to reach the players and the coach. “No damage was done to the Moses Mabhida Stadium, according to the report that I got," revealed Stadium manager at Moses Mabhida, Vusi Mazibuko. "I want to thank our team of security for the good work they did. They anticipated the situation and no damage to property was made and no people were injured. "What happened was uncalled for. This trend of people fighting when they lose is not on. It is not only happening in football it is also happening in politics, families and in sports. It is not right. This needs to be address. People need to accept defeat in a right manner." Chiefs are schedule to play three of their 15 home matches at Moses Mabhida this season. The iconic venue will also host the MTN 8 cup final between Cape Town City and SuperSport United next weekend. “Such behaviour from the fans will not jeopardise our chances of hosting major sports events,” Mazibuko elaborated. "We are not afraid at all but we are worried that people want to solve problems by fighting each other. This is not right. As the stadium we are always ready for such situations and we are not condoning it." Moses Mabhida will also host the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between Bafana Bafana and Libya next year in March. The Star   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
