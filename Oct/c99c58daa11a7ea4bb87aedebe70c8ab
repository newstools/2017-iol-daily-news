Dr Macken Mistry Primary School became the first in the province to receive solar lanterns for each pupil. Each pupil also received a book from non-profit organisation Enabling Africa. Most of the about 800 
pupils at the school are from the nearby informal settlements in Kenville where there is no electricity supply. Principal Pompey Sookhul said the lanterns would improve the literacy levels of the pupils. In October last year, Sookhul had a networking session with Benoni's Actonville Primary School principal Vanessa Moodley. Actonville was the recipient of the Enabling Africa project and had recommended Dr Macken Mistry as a beneficiary. Enabling Africa’s two chief executives, Gary Carroll and Chris Kelway, donated 1 000 solar lanterns to the school. The team also received a donation of 800 books for the school from Bargain Books and Rotary International. The solar lantern takes four hours to charge and provides six hours of strong light. “These children come from desperate home environments. Even the simple task of completing homework in the evenings is complicated by a lack of resources. This puts them at an educational disadvantage right from the start and hinders their ability to perform well at school,” said Kelway. Many of the pupils also do not have an open or quiet space to read at home. This led to Enabling Africa, in partnership with Mark Pretorius of Marlin Laboratory, renovating the school library. Pretorius and volunteers painted the library, put in new carpets, bean bags, curtains and fans. Daily News
