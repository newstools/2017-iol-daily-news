Durban - Umlazi police are investigating a charge of murder and two of attempted murder following a shooting at the Glebelands Hostel at the weekend. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the three, aged 25, 30 and 37, were rushed to hospital. “The 37-year old victim succumbed to his injuries this morning. The motive is unknown,” Zwane said. It is alleged that the three were sitting in a room at Block K at the hostel on Friday night when the shooting occurred. Vanessa Burger, independent community activist, claimed that the deceased was originally from Harding on the south coast. He was believed to a previous resident from Block 49 but went to live at Block K after violence broke out a few years back. “There appears to have been an increase in the number of attacks on residents living in blocks near the old tennis courts at Blocks H, I, J, K, L in recent months, an area previously mostly untouched by the hostel violence,” Burger said. The killings continue despite the ongoing Moerane Commission, a special commission set up to look into political killings in the province. There have been at least 95 murders at the hostel. Daily News
