The session was used to encourage pupils and to reassure them that no matter the outcome, there was always a way for them to move forward. Thembi Mbhele, of uMlazi Secondary School, said: “During this time, pupils are very stressed and lose faith in themselves. Some pupils feel that if they do not perform as well as they think they should, they are failures. But I believe that pupils should be hopeful and try their best." Tozi Mthethwa, the municipality’s spokesperson, said the session was also used to pray for residents as the city was recently hit by a storm that left a trail of destruction. The line-up included religious leaders who offered words of encouragement to pupils. eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede addressed the crowd on the importance of education and spirituality. “As the time has come for pupils to write their final exams, I encourage you all to not lose faith and keep preparing for each paper.” Nombuso Mlambo, a pupil of KwaDukuza Secondary, said writing matric exams was something that always scared her, but she was grateful for the support from the municipality. “I believe that more sessions like this should take place, whether it is matric exams or not,” she said.
