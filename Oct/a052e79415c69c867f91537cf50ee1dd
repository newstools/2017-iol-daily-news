Durban - More than 1 000 KwaZulu-Natal police officers do not have competency certificates and 125 are not yet competent to carry firearms but still do. This is according to Dianne Kohler Barnard, the Democratic Alliance's Shadow Minister of Police. Nationally, there are 11 334 officers without competency certificates and 3 473 carrying firearms but are not yet competent. According to the DA, in a reply to a question they asked in Parliament, they were told that 3 500 uncertified police officers continue to carry firearms. "It also detailed how approximately 11 000 officers do not have competency certificates. The DA will ask Parliamentary questions to find out how many of these officers unlawfully fired their gun and ended up injuring or killing a civilian," she said. Police issue firearm permits to police officials only if they can prove that they are fit and proper and that they successfully completed training to safely handle a firearm. "Therefore, SAPS have failed to ensure that thousands of police officials are in fact fit to have and use their guns. This not only puts the South African public in danger but also the police officials themselves. Anyone carrying a firearm without a license faces up to 15 years in prison. The police are already grossly under-trained throughout our country. For thousands of officers, who are meant to be custodians of our safety and security, to continue to carry firearms while not being properly certified, only increases danger for ordinary South Africans," Kohler Barnard said. The Police Ministry is yet to comment. Daily News
