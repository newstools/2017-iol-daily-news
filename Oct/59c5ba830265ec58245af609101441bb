Durban - The eThekwini Municipality’s Electricity Unit said it received approximately 570 faults that were reported during Tuesday’s heavy rainfall. Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson said technicians have been working around the clock to restore power to affected residents. “While power has been restored in most affected areas, the southern parts of Durban bore the brunt of the storm and areas that were without power this morning are: Kingsburgh, Lower Illovo, Athlone Park, Nsimbini, uMlazi T-section, uMlazi Q-section, Plangweni, uMbilo, Zwelibomvu, Mobeni, Intake/Demat and Tafelkop,” said Mthethwa. She said road closures, hazardous driving conditions and heavy rains made it dangerous and difficult for technical staff to attend to faults on Tuesday, which caused further delays. “Our Contact Centres were inundated with calls from affected residents who suffered call waiting times in excess of an hour during the course of yesterday due to the high volume of complaints,” said Mthethwa. She also said the Municipality thanks the public for being patient and cooperative during the inclement weather conditions. Customers are urged to report their faults via the SMS line, 083 700 0819, email address custocare@elec.durban.gov.za or via the website www.durban.gov.za (go to online services), should they have difficulty reaching us via the toll free number 080 1313 111.
