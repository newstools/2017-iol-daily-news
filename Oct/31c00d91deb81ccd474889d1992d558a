The bank also launched other collectable Tambo centenary coins at an event in Ekurhuleni. “The late OR Tambo played a pivotal role in the country’s struggle against apartheid. His stewardship of the liberation movement galvanised world opinion against apartheid,’’ the SARB said yesterday. “The new R5 coin, worth its face value, entered circulation from October 1, and the other collectable coins will be available from the South African Mint and authorised dealers from October 27, OR Tambo’s 100th anniversary.’’ The back of the coin features a neck badge and walking stick. The obverse depicts the national coat of arms, year of issue and South Africa written in English and Xitsonga. The soon-to-be-released collectable coin range depicts Tambo during his youth and presidency of the ANC. The coins will not be in circulation, are not redeemable at banks or for use to purchase products or services. “This is the first time that the South African Mint is releasing a non-circulating, collectable legal tender coin made from the same base metal used in other South African circulation coins,” the SARB said. “The design has gone through the same approval process as other legal tender commemorative coins, and has been approved by the cabinet and the minister of finance, which makes it legal tender.’’ - ANA
