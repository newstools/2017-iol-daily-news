Neeri Naidoo, of Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment (Pact), said they had more than 20 calls on Thursday with complaints of missing or injured animals. “It is going to be very busy for us in the coming days dealing with the aftermath of the big bangs. It is going to take days as the lost-, found- and injured calls are going to start coming in,” she said. Pact covers Phoenix and surrounding areas up to Verulam. Lindsey Concer, Durban and Coast SPCA marketing manager, said it was a fairly quiet night. She said they had five collections of stray animals, and one rescue where a pet was stuck between two fences. Stuck “These animals were found in the areas of Shallcross, Yellowwood Park, Phoenix and Chris Hani (North Coast) Road. “As always during this time, we expect many more strays to come through in the next few days and we most likely will receive lost reports throughout the day,” she said. Concer added that they had received fewer call-outs than last year, but it was still early to determine exact numbers. The numbers were expected to grow. “Residents need to make the SPCA their first port of call should they find a lost or stray animal, or if they have a missing pet. “Animals are kept at the SPCA for seven days before they are put up for adoption. “If a pet has gone missing, residents must visit their local SPCAs within the seven-day time frame,” she said. Reports circulated, via social media, of scores of residents being taken to hospital for various wounds sustained from handling fireworks. Leanny Nyiri, regional marketing manager of Life Healthcare, said they had received a few patients who were treated for minor burns. Provincial Emergency Services, Rescue Care, Crisis Care Medical, ER24 and Netcare spokespeople said no incidents were reported to them. Daily News
