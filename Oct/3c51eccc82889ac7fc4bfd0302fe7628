Police officers spoke to the Daily News  after the release of the national crime statistics for April 1, 2016 to March31, 2017. They referred to the various work issues that had affected how they went about their duties. A constable who asked not to be named said his colleagues were often divided because of race issues. “It is all about the colour of your skin. Your experience does not mean much (when it comes to promotions). Then there are issues of the police working with criminals. They are involved in crime.  I love my job but there are times that I hate it,” he said. A detective who has been with the police service for 27 years, said often there were people given promotions who were not qualified for the post. This was particularly the case where they had relatives in senior posts.  “You also find juniors moving into higher posts, and that demoralises the others who have been working to get into senior posts. A clerk will move into an officer’s or management position with no policing experience. There are also times when detectives are stuck behind a desk having to do administrative duties instead of being out in the field,” he said. The detective said damaged vehicles were another factor that hindered police from patrolling and reporting to scenes on time. “Vehicles get damaged, need maintenance and end up at the garage for four months. For me, the private sector is calling,” the detective said. A fellow officer, who recently retired, said he had done so with a heavy heart. “I loved my job but promotion was out. I worked in the police service for 33 years with a clean record. I gave up and left,” the former warrant officer said. A former policeman echoed these sentiments. “There was a lack of leadership. I did extremely well and they overlooked my promotion. That was very hurtful,” 
he said. Daily News
