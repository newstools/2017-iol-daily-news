McBride made his third appearance for allegedly assaulting his daughter two months ago. The 15-year-old daughter claimed he beat and throttled her. During his previous appearance in August, McBride was granted R10000 bail and the case was postponed. The bail was maintained and the magistrate emphasised his bail conditions - he is forbidden from making contact with any of the witnesses or contacting them through a third party. McBride has denied he assaulted his daughter. In a statement released immediately after the August 19 alleged incident, McBride claimed he had merely admonished her. He also said he was not surprised by the allegations as they were probably being used by his detractors to settle scores after they had failed to remove him as the Ipid head. However, the teenager reportedly said the alleged assault was not an isolated incident. She claimed it happened often. McBride has been charged with child abuse with an alternative charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Last week, the Johannesburg High Court declared it was illegal to spank children. It found that the common law defence of “reasonable chastisement” was not in line with the constitution. It ruled parents would no longer be able to use it as a legal argument for spanking their children. McBride’s case was postponed to November 28. This is for the State to provide him with the contents of the docket and prepare for trial.
