Durban - The eThekwini recycling programme, which is better known as the orange bags recycling programme, is temporarily closed after the plant was affected by after the storm in Durban. Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality Head of Communications said Durban Solid Waste Unit (DSW) had informed residents that their recycling partner, MPACT was severely damaged during the storm and cannot accept recycling bags from contractors and collectors until repairs are completed, which will likely take four weeks. “Due to these challenges, DSW would like to request all residents to keep their recyclables in their orange and clear bags in their homes or yards until further notice,” said Mthethwa.
