Media reports last week suggested Zuma had allegedly been granted residency in the UAE and might have relocated and is already living there. Zuma and his fellow Aurora Empowerment Systems directors Fazel and Solly Bhana; former president Nelson Mandela’s grandson Zondwa Mandela; and Thulani Ngubani; were found guilty by the Pretoria High Court of reckless and negligent management of the Pamodzi Group mining assets dating back to 2009. Zuma, who was chairing Aurora, and his fellow directors were then held liable for the R1.5billion in damages to the mining assets. As a result of the conviction, the Aurora directors entered into settlement agreements with the Pamodzi liquidators. The money to be derived would be used to pay the outstanding salaries of the 5300 former Aurora employees to whom millions of rand of outstanding compensation is owed. The liquidators have brought an application for Zuma’s sequestration which will be heard by the Durban High Court on December 8. Solidarity’s general secretary, Gideon du Plessis, said Zuma failed  to make the agreed monthly payment of R500000 in July. “In terms of the original agreement Zuma has to repay R23million, but if he fails to comply he will be held liable for all the damage amounting to R1.5bn. However, Zuma only repaid R9.5m of the agreed amount,” he said. “The Insolvency Act stipulates that when a person has skipped the country to dodge creditors his assets may be seized in the country fled to.” - ANA
