He was speaking earlier this week at the unveiling of a bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Wales. The 300kg statue, at Lloyd George Avenue in Cardiff Bay, depicts Gandhi holding a stick in one hand, and the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, in the other. The 1.82m statue was created by sculptors Ram Sutar and his son, Anil, of Delhi, India. It took the Hindu Council of Wales (HCW) three years to raise more than half a million rand, said Dhupelia, Gandhi’s great-grandson. “The people of Cardiff and Wales are warm-hearted and friendly, with an aura of peace and love. I  met a good cross-section of them, and even the random strangers I chatted with all exuded exactly the same aura,” Dhupelia said. Gandhi might not have visited Wales, but his spirit and teachings are alive and reverberate through Cardiff. Flow “The world is awash with violence and conflict, and now more than ever there is a dire need to change the flow of ongoing conflict to opening dialogue and showing mutual respect for each other and working towards finding solutions that make both sides happy so that they can co-exist in harmony,” he said. This is the first statue of Gandhi in Wales. There are others in London - one was placed in Parliament Square in March 2015. Also in the square are statues of Nelson Mandela and former British prime minister Winston Churchill. Dhupelia said of the Wales statue: “The statue reminds people that peaceful types of solutions can be found and are better than engaging in war or physical conflict, for in war there are really no winners.” Vimla Patel, chairperson of the HCW council, told Wales online news that Gandhi was an inspiration to current and future generations to live together in peace and harmony, and to treat one another with love and respect irrespective of religion, culture or race. The Sutar sculptors have created more than 50 bronze statues of Gandhi throughout the world. Daily News
