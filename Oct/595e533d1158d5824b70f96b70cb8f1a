Durban - Fawzia Peer, eThekwini Municipality deputy mayor, has called for multi-pronged approach to fighting crime in the city. "We need for all forces to join hands and work together. We cannot sit back and say this is not our job. Metro Police, the South African Police Services, government, security companies and residents need to work together," she said. Peer was speaking at the Business Crime Prevention presentation, hosted by the Safety and Justice Business Forum at the Durban Chamber of Commerce on Friday morning. She reiterated government's commitment to working towards a better life for residents. "As we unwind from a busy year, criminals are gearing up and waiting for an opportune time to pounce on residents and businesses. We cannot be complacent," she said. Peer said the police alone cannot win the fight against crime. Peer said although the solution to the problems presented to them would not come about overnight, there needs to be an enhanced relationship between all spheres of the community. "This includes partnerships between police, private security and the community. When a crime happens, we need to collate all the information so we can focus on hot spots. There must be a greater system to share information," Peer said. She added that there needs to be online maps with crime reports published every month and a need for DNA samples to be taken from criminals. Peer said there also needs to be monthly reports presented to residents for them to be aware of crime trends. Chris Overall of the Safety and Justice Forum, said since the start of the year, there have been 230 cash in transit robberies across the country. "There has also been a 150 per cent increase in retail robberies and a 400 per cent increase in the use of plastic explosives during a robbery," Overall said. He echoed Peer's sentiments for a joint working solution. Daily News
