The 4th annual Innovation Durban Festival, currently taking place at Moses Mabhida Stadium, is aimed at empowering the youth by focusing on creative art, design and infrastructure within the eThekwini Municipality.
The launch of the event kicked off with a ladies’ breakfast that highlighted opportunities available for women who come from impoverished backgrounds. Amanda Mathe, the event co- ordinator, said: “Our goal is to empower 1000 women in digital literacy in each metro. We are targeting black African females and hoping we can provide them with the necessary resources to improve their economic situation by becoming proactive citizens by starting their own businesses.” The theme of the festival is “Creating a Future Durban”, and on display is a collaboration of local innovation and development as well as information and communications technology. On Wednesday, a panel of female leaders in the business sector shared the secret to their success. Fundisile Serame, chief executive at Technofundis, shared her passion for business, leadership and female empowerment. “I started from humble beginnings to get to where I am today. I believe that in South Africa there is a huge scope for females in information technology, as it is no longer a profession just for males,” said Serame. Aurelia Albert, the festival’s interim chief executive, felt that Durban was at a very exciting growth stage, with much innovation taking place. The Innovation Durban Festival runs until Friday.
