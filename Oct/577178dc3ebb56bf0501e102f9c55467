Durban - A 32-year-old man was arrested in Inanda, north of Durban, for possession of an unlicensed firearm, possession of drugs and possession of a bullet proof vest and police jacket. The man was arrested during an intelligence-driven operation which was conducted on Thursday night in Inanda, with the help of Inanda Crime Prevention members, said Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. “The members were following up information about an unlicensed firearm at Inanda area yesterday. They approached the suspect at Machobeni area and he was searched. The members found an unlicensed 9mm pistol with 15 live ammunition. The man was also found in possession of 124 mandrax tablets,” Zwane said. “On further investigation, the police took him to his place of residence where a bullet proof vest belonging to correctional services was recovered. A jacket belonging to SAPS was also recovered,” continued Zwane. He also said that the man is suspected of supplying drugs to small dealers in KwaMashu, Inanda and Ntuzuma. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, welcomed the arrest and the recovery of the drugs and firearm. Langa said, “The recovered firearm will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if it was used in any other crimes in the province. I further appeal to the community members to work together with the police in the fight against crime by reporting any criminal activities in their areas.” The man will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Friday.
