Durban - Eighteen high school pupils have been released on bail and under strict bail restrictions after they were caught throwing condoms filled with urine and faeces at each other and teachers earlier this week. At least 30 pupils were nabbed by police at the Eastwood High School in Pietermaritzburg. Sihle Mlotshwa, spokesperson at the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education, said they negotiated with the senior prosecutor to bring forward the date of the hearing. "All Eastwood learners who were detained have been released on bail under strict conditions," he said. On Tuesday, Mountain Rise Police with the assistance of Public Order Police responded to a complaint of disruptive behaviour of pupils at the school. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokesperson, said pupils were instructed to cease their disruptive behaviour but some still continued to throw condoms containing excrement, urine, eggs, stones and milk. "The school building was damaged as well as private vehicles of educators. Educators and other learners were also being hit with these items. A learner was injured on the hand with a sharp object, alleged to be a knife, and was rushed to hospital for medical assistance," she said.The situation at the school is being very closely monitored due to death threats against the teachers and the school has received a bomb threat.
