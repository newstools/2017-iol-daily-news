Durban - Two men were arrested while two more are on the run following a high speed chase and shootout in Verulam in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The gang was spotted allegedly trying to steal a Mitsubishi Colt bakkie, parked along Wesbrook Drive in Oaklands. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson, said when they arrived at the scene, they saw the gang speeding off in a VW Golf down Oaklands Drive. “The gang drove towards a housing complex. The men began shooting at Rusa officers, who returned fire. Two men were arrested and their two accomplices managed to get away,” Balram said.
