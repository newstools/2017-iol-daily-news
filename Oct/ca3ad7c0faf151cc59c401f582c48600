Durban - Eight members from two separate Sibiya family homes were brutally murdered at Amatimatolo, in Greytown in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday night. In response, Major-General Bheki Langa, acting Provincial Commissioner in the province, condemned the attack on the Sibiya homes and said the horrendous act shows that there are people who do not value other people’s lives. Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson explained what happened in both incidents. “Last night at 9pm, at Embangweni area, Amatimatolo, five Sibiya family members were inside the rondavel when gunshots were heard. The community members checked and saw the house on fire. Attempts were made to rescue them, unfortunately the fire was uncontrollable. All five family members, a 60-year-old woman with four children aged between two and 16 died at the scene,” said Gwala. “One hundred metres away from the first scene, gunshots were also heard and another Sibiya family house with four family members was on fire. The community members managed to rescue three children who sustained burn wounds but unfortunately a 58-year-old woman died at the scene. She had sustained a gunshot wound and burn wounds. The children were taken to hospital where two of them succumbed to their injuries,” Gwala continued. Gwala said police will leave no stone unturned and will ensure that the killers will face the full might of the law. “They have to receive a befitting sentence during prosecution for their inhumane behaviour,” Gwala said. She also said the motive of the attack is not yet known. Eight counts of murder and one count of attempted murder were opened at Amatimatolo SAPS for investigation. Daily News
