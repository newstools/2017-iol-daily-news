Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) said they had managed to moor three vessels that had been grounded during the storm. This was done in partnership with the South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) and African Marine Solutions. The operation involved eight tugboats and lasted nearly three hours. TNPA chief executive Shulami Qalinge said: “We are extremely appreciative of the excellent collaboration between our TNPA marine teams and key stakeholders who acted quickly and efficiently.” Port operations at Richards Bay also resumed on Wednesday. Mop-up operations were under way and sounding surveys were being conducted to check for any build-up or obstruction on the seabed that could pose a risk to shipping. “Engineering teams aided by aerial drones are conducting physical assessments of port buildings and infrastructure to assist in quantifying damage,” TNPA said. TNPA  expected operations to return to normal by midday on Thursday. Daily News
