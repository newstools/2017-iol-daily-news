Durban - KwaZulu-Natal has lost 65 firearms from its armoury since April 2017, the highest loss compared to the other provinces. Gauteng had lost 45 guns during the same period. In a reply to parliamentary questions by the Democratic Alliance, the SAPS revealed that 2 027 guns were stolen from police armouries in the last four years. According to the reply, 602 guns were stolen in 2014/15, 630 in 2015/16, 537 in 2016/17 and 248 since the beginning of April this year countrywide. Dianne Kohler Barnard DA spokesperson on police said the SAPS was fuelling the illegal arms trade. Barnard said thousands of SAPS firearms have been stolen over the past 20 years, and are out there in the hands of criminals shooting at the police, and at you and me. This, she said, was the result of institutional failure at the SAPS. She said adequate, quality training on professional policing that is continually updated and refreshed was needed to improve the police service. “This high number of “missing” firearms goes far beyond the occasional case of negligence and is evidence of a problem that is not unrelated to high levels of corruption and criminality within the SAPS. Four thousand Beretta pistols cost around R18 million, and that sort of order is made regularly to replace the thousands of firearms disappearing from the SAPS armouries. The DA will therefore conduct oversight visits to SAPS armouries to pose crucial questions on security arrangements at these armouries and insist that the Minister orders a full national audit of all SAPS firearms,” she said in a statement. Between 2016/17, 147 firearms were stolen from KZN police and the number was 163 in 2015/16. Only eight firearms were stolen out of office, according to the reply. Daily News
