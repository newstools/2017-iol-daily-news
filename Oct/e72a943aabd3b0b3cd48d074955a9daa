Durban - Charges against three Pietermaritzburg College pupils pictured holding up politically-branded shirts, have been dropped. The pupils, who cannot be named as they are still minors, faced six counts, including inciting violence, racism and violating the Schools Act. Last week, an image of the Grade 12 boys holding up the shirts went viral on social media. The photograph was further shared by Julius Malema, President of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Sihle Mlothshwa, spokesperson for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education said the school confirmed that the charges against the boys had been dropped. He added that the outcome of the investigation is going to determine the next steps taken. On Friday, a picture of three Grade 12 pupils in Maritzburg College uniform with a T-shirt brandishing the message, “EFF, our last hope of getting our land back”, went viral on social media. According to the Schools Act, political activities are prohibited at public schools. The boys are expected to face a disciplinary hearing later this month. It is believed that one of the boys who was charged was called the K-word by a prefect at the school earlier this year. Daily News
