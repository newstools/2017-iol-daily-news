“It was hard, very hard, particularly for his mother,” the little boy’s father, Charles Khutyiswayo, recalled last night. Nqobile Nkonyeni, 19, who also uses the surname Ndovela, had allegedly taken the baby after visiting the family home in the Mbayimbi area of Murchison, Port Shepstone, last month. Christopher’s parents were at work at the time and had left him in the care of the woman. “She just disappeared with Christopher and we did not know where she was. We called her on her cellphone but she never answered,” Khutyiswayo said. A warrant of arrest was issued for Ndovela, with the police calling on the public for information to help trace Ndovela and Christopher. Christopher was found on Friday and was reunited with his parents. According to a statement by the KZN SAPS, Ndovela allegedly left the baby at a relative’s house on Thursday, saying she was going to pay for the metered-taxi they had been in. She then fled, leaving the child behind. “Christopher was really happy to see us. We don’t understand why this happened,” Khutyiswayo said. “Nqobile is a relative. We won’t be able to trust her anymore.” Police are still looking for Ndovela. They have appealed for anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact Constable Nurse Ngubane at 0396887900 or 0823349682 or Crime Stop at 0860010111. Daily News
