Durban - An Indian crew member was evacuated off the bulk carrier, Bochem Oslo, off the Port of Durban on Thursday afternoon, after suffering chest pains. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Durban crew was dispatched by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following a request for medical assistance, said Clifford Ireland, NSRI Durban station commander. Ireland said the sea rescue craft Eikos Rescuer II was accompanied by two Netcare 911 rescue paramedics. A TNPA helicopter was also dispatched from Richard’s Bay, which landed at NSRI Durban base where an NSRI Durban rescue swimmer and a Netcare 911 rescue paramedic were taken onboard before heading for the ship. “On arrival on the scene the TNPA helicopter hoisted the NSRI Durban rescue swimmer and the Netcare 911 rescue paramedic onto the ship where they stabilised the patient,” said Ireland. “The patient was hoisted into the helicopter secured onto a stretcher and the paramedic was hoisted into the helicopter and the patient was flown to a Durban hospital,” Ireland said. The man was suspected of suffering from a heart attack. Daily News
