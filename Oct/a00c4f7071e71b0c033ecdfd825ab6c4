Durban - A minibus taxi filled with school children crashed on Thursday, leaving seven scholars and the driver injured at a village along the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Nick Dollman, Netcare spokesperson said paramedics responded to the scene of the incident on the corners of Alford Avenue and Oswald Road early Thursday morning.
