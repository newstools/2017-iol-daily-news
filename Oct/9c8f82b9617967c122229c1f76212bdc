The rise in complaints had placed considerable pressure on the complaints resolution process at the tax ombud office because the number of staff members dealing with the complaints had not increased. The report highlighted almost 20 issues raised by taxpayers or their representatives, which are considered either “serious” or “systemic”. One issue raised by taxpayers was Sars's raising assessments to offset tax credits without a valid reason. The tax ombud’s mandate has been widened to allow for investigations into systemic problems. The first report has dealt with the issue of delayed payment of refunds and the financial hardship it continues to cause taxpayers. Last month, the Office of the Tax Ombud found that the withholding of tax refunds by Sars had become a systemic problem and said this had resulted in financial hardship to taxpayers. Mark Kingon, the head of relationship management at Sars, said yesterday they had started implementing certain steps to adhere to the ombud's recommendations. A  systemic problem raised by the ombud related to instances where Sars incorrectly raised assessments where there was a credit amount due to the taxpayer, but the correct process was not followed. “We have terminated these steps,” Kingon said. Sars has also taken steps in terms of VAT refunds, and have committed to making system changes for income tax. Sars has also been accused of not following the timelines set out in the Tax Administration Act. Kingon referred to instances where the payment of refunds had been stopped because of valid reasons, but the “stoppers” had not been lifted timeously when taxpayers had complied with all the requirements necessary to get their refund. He gave the assurance that they were putting steps in place to ensure that once the taxpayer had complied, the stoppers would be lifted timeously. Sars was also looking at “pro-active ways” for the changing of banking details and of verifying them. Daily News
