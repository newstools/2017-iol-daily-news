Minutes later, a tree crashed through the asbestos roof and the house slowly collapsed around her. Naidoo is just one of many residents in the Durban South area waiting for aid from the eThekwini Municipality after one of the worst storms ever to hit the area caused huge damage. Naidoo, of Malukazi, behind Isipingo`s Lotus Park, was alone in the house when she felt the house shaking. “The wind was howling. I prayed to God for help. I heard a bang and then a tree came through the roof. The branches struck my back as it landed, scraping me. I then tried opening the door, but it was jammed. My neighbour came to assist me. I was drenched and in shock,” Naidoo said. The one-bedroom house had been her home for 10 years. She shared it with her 7-year-old daughter, Sudisha, and 61-year-old father. They were both not at 
home at the time. Thieves have since stolen some of the house’s tin sheeting. In the interim, the Isipingo Women’s Forum (IWF) has stepped in to co-ordinate relief efforts with assistance from the Al-Imdaad Foundation. IWF co-ordinator Zarina 
Assan said they had supplied a few affected residents with grocery hampers and sheets of roofing, but she was desperate to get more building material. Assan said 20 homes were damaged. Mbangeni Mjadu, the ward councillor, has submitted the names of the affected families to the municipality and had granted Al-Imdaad permission to help the storm victims. “They have survived living in poor conditions for decades. Their plight is real. “We need to get them back on their feet and give them some hope and dignity,” Assan said. “Victims are sharing homes with others. Some homes 
are already overcrowded,” she said. Daily News
