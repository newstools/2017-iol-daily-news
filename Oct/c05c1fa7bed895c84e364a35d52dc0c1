Durban - Police are investigating a robbery at a home in La Lucia during which the home owner was assaulted. According to Blue Security at around 2.10pm on Wednesday, armed robbers stormed the north Durban home, where they assaulted the homeowners before fleeing with jewellery and other valuable items. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security Community and Media Liaison Officer said the men had arrived in a white KIA SUV and jumped over the back wall in order to gain access onto the Homeford Drive property. “Five suspects entered the house and assaulted the resident and his mother before ransacking the property. They fled with safes, jewellery, cellphones, laptops, house keys, remotes and vehicle keys,” Mathios said. Police were on scene and have launched an investigation. In a separate incident an elderly couple was left traumatised after they were bound and the man hit with a firearm after five armed men with two handguns and two larger firearms forced their way into the house last Friday.
