The councillor was allegedly involved in the illegal sale of two city-owned property stands for a total of R210 000. A city employee was also arrested. It is alleged that the councillor and the employee are in a relationship. City investigators allege that monies from the illicit transaction were paid into the employeeâ€™s bank account, and then transferred to the councillor. It is alleged that the councillor sold the first stand to his first victim between December last year and January this year for R80 000. The victim started building on the property and was stopped by residents who indicated that the site was earmarked for a soccer field. The second victim was sold a stand for R130 000. The victim became aware of the fraud when she tried to sell the stand. Both suspects will appear in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court soon, charged with fraud and corruption. ANA
