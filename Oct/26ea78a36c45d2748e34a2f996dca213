Durban - Fraudsters are using the Durban storm for financial gain by pretending to be eThekwini officials and demanding payment in order to register storm victims. Durban was recently battered following a storm that claimed lives and destroyed property. Mthunzi Gumede, the eThekwini mayor’s spokesperson said: “It has come to our attention that certain unscrupulous individuals are fraudulently posing as eThekwini officials who have been sent by the Mayor to register people affected by the recent storms. It is alleged that these culprits are charging vulnerable people a fee for the alleged registration.” Gumede said the municipality strongly condemns this behaviour and assures eThekwini residents that no payment is required from them in order to receive assistance from the government. “Residents are urged to be weary of this criminal behaviour and be cautious when allowing people into their homes,” said Gumede. Residents with homes damaged by the storm have been encouraged to report to their local Councillor or call the Disaster Management Centre on 031 367 0039 during office hours. The Emergency number is 031 361 0000. Daily News
