The couple tied the knot at the Bloemfontein Botanical Gardens in front of over 200 guests. Some of the names on the guest list included: Springbok flank Siya Kolisi, Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya, long jumper Ruswahl Samaai and TV presenter Siv Ngesi. On Sunday, Van Niekerk posted a photo of he and his bride seated side by side. Van Niekerk wore a black suit with a white shirt and waistcoat. He accessorised with a white boutonnière, which matched his bride’s dress. Campbell wore a lace detailed, round-collared, short-sleeved gown. Her veil fitted in at the centre of her slicked-back hair. In the post he wrote: “Can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you Chesney van Niekerk! So blessed to start this next adventure with the girl of my dreams!”  And the most important is love. 🕇 ❤ A post shared by Wayde van Niekerk (@waydedreamer) on Oct 29, 2017 at 12:53am PDT Van Niekerk is an Olympic and world championship gold medallist and holds the world mark at 43.03sec.
