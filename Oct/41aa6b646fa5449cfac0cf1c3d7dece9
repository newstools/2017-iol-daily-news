Durban - A team led by the Hawks, who were assisted by police detectives, crime intelligence and other specialised units arrested a councillor from Amajuba District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. It is alleged that the councillor had conspired and orchestrated the bombing of another councillors house in Newcastle in 2015, said Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi of the Hawks. Mulaudzi said unknown men had planted explosives which later discharged and caused damage. At the time it was suspected that the explosion was caused by poor plumbing since the explosives were allegedly hidden near the geyser. At the time a case was not opened but in September the team received information. “It is understood that the two councillors had a fallout, also liked are allegations of undue influence and possible corruption. With that in mind the suspect conspired to slay his confidante with a view not to expose him from his alleged underground dealings,” said Mulaudzi. He said the councillor then allegedly approached a potential witness not to cooperate with the probe and promised them cash in return. The councillor was charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, defeating the ends of justice and violation of the explosives act. Investigations continue as he is expected to appear at the Madadeni Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Daily News
