Durban - A private security company has come under scrutiny after a member shot dead an unarmed man in Shallcross, Chatsworth, on Wednesday afternoon. Nolan Naidoo, 35, had gone to his mother’s house to ask for money. He was believed to have been a drug addict. It is alleged that a woman had pressed a panic button, alerting the guard to an incident on her property. The guard arrived and an altercation ensued. The guard shot the man in the chest. In a statement posted on their Facebook page, Mzansi Security said the guard responded to a panic alarm from a residence in Shallcross. “Upon arrival the lady had complained again, about abuse by her drug addicted son, who had already left the property by the time we arrived. As the reaction officer was about to depart he heard the lady scream for help, as the male had returned. Our reaction officer approached the male in order to defuse the situation,” the statement read.   Mzansi claimed that Naidoo was aggressive and attempted to assault the reaction officer. He also tried to disarm the guard. They added that the reaction officer responded by using his firearm. “The suspect sustained a single gunshot wound to his abdomen. This matter is now subject to a police investigation. Mzansi always maintains minimum force policy whilst executing an arrest,” the statement said. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, confirmed that the guard was charged for murder. He is expected to appear in court on Thursday. Daily News
