Durban - Service delivery protests flared up in Cato Manor on Thursday. Irate residents living in the informal settlement along Vusi Mzimela (Bellair) Road barricaded the road. They also broke bottles and threw them along the road. They claim that the municipality were taking too long to provide them with decent housing. Some have been living in shacks for over a decade. Metro Police arrived at the scene at 6am and found piles of debris burning on the road. An officer at the scene said members quickly formed a human shield and tried to disperse the mob. When police tried to open the roadway to allow for a smooth flow of traffic, they were pelted with rocks. Police had to use rubber bullets and stun grenades. Riot police descended on the area and were keeping a watchful eye on the protesters who were taunting police a few hundred metres aways. This protest comes on the back of another incident in Bonela where angry shack dwellers and residents took each other on, at the weekend. The area has been rocked by violent protests in the last two months. Daily News
