Thembinkosi American Ngcobo made a brief appearance in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday where it was established that he had acquired the services of a new legal team. Major-General Mafi Mgobozi, SANDF spokesperson, said Ngcobo was remanded and the case was adjourned until next month. “From what we know, he did not have a good relationship with his previous lawyer. In court today, his new legal representation asked for time to read through the docket. He will appear in court in November,” Mgobozi said. In January this year, Ngcobo allegedly told his commanding officer in Upington, where he was based, that he was on a mission to kill his fiancé and their two-month-old baby. He denied the child’s paternity. Ngcobo was a Rifleman with the 8 South African Infantry Battalion. During his bail application in February, Investigating officer Lieutenant-Colonel Wise Mabanga testified that it was discovered that Ngcobo had deserted his post during the night. He was due to stand guard at the base but had complained of a sore stomach. It is alleged that he then left the base. It was later revealed that Ngcobo had taken his cellphone and belongings. He had driven to Durban in a fit of jealousy. There, he allegedly shot his girlfriend’s sister and her friend. A policeman was also wounded in the January 31 incident. Mabanga had told the court he had called Ngcobo, who apparently said he had killed his sister-in-law. This was when Mabanga pleaded with him to surrender himself. The soldier eventually handed himself over to police in February. Daily News
