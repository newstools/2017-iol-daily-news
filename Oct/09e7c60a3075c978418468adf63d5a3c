The Pietermaritzburg man was caught with at least R10 million in cash at Cape Town International Airport. The 38-year-old man was about to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates when customs officials impounded his two suitcases. Brigadier Neil Oliver, acting head of the Directorate for Priority Crime (the Hawks), said the matter was being handled by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Unit. ‘Our probe will be to determine the trail and origin of the money. We cannot rule out unearthing illicit activities as we go along,’ he said. The man is expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court today on charges of contravening Section 15 of the Customs and Excise Act 91/1994, which relates to the failure to declare items being taken out of the country.
