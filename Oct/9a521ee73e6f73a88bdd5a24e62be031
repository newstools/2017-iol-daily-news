Zikalala was testifying in Durban before the Moerane Commission of Inquiry investigating the killing of politicians in KZN. “The death of one councillor would impact on who is the mayor, who is the speaker, and how the council itself is led,” said Zikalala. He made an example of councillor Sifiso Mkhize of uPhongolo Municipality, who was killed in June. Mkhize was among several councillors whose murders were followed by by-elections. Zikalala said there were more than 80 politicians who had been killed in KZN since 2011, with the ANC topping the list of party members killed because of internal power struggles. Zikalala told the commission on Thursday that the ANC had established there had been 29 politicians killed since last year. He said 19 of belonged to the party, with the IFP, NFP and SACP having three each, and one from the EFF. “The ANC agrees that it is one organisation mostly affected by the killings, judging by the number of incidents affecting its leaders,” said Zikalala. He said there had been 78 politically-related arrests, including 25 for murder, 10 for attempted murder, and 12 for arson. Daily News
