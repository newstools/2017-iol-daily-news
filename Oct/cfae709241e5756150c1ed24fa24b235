The cracks, according to Harish Budhoo, were caused by a leak from a municipal pool near his home. He said he had been involved in a dispute with the municipality for the past decade over who should foot the bill to fix his walls. Budhoo and his family have been living at their Firwood Road home for the past 41 years. He noticed cracks forming in the walls of the house, and found that water was leaking from the municipal pool. “My family’s life is in danger. They (the municipality) keep having site meetings, saying they are trying to find the leak. The pool has been drained, but who fixes the damage already caused by the leaking water? They are not bothered to assess the damage done,” Budhoo said. Responding to his claims, municipal spokesperson Tozi Mthethwa said a team from the architectural department was investigating the leak in the pool. “Since receiving the complaint, we have engaged with the stormwater department. A team from the water and sanitation department has also been on site to investigate. The complainant alleging that the cracks on his house walls are due to the water leakage from the pool is also under investigation,” she said. Mthethwa said that the city would not accept liability because its units were still investigating. The pool was drained in July and the architectural department would further conduct a gas leak detection exercise. “Our department has engaged with Mr Budhoo since receiving the complaint, and we are awaiting further feedback from the architectural department,” Mthethwa said.
