Durban North resident, 19-year-old Cole Pretorius was selected to represent South Africa at the U8 Baseball World Cup and has also been chosen to represent the World Select Team on a tour in the United States of America. Players from Africa are slowly changing the face of baseball and making their mark in the sport. Teams from North America, Latin America and Japan will no longer be the only ones people think of when Major League Baseball (MLB) comes to mind. Pretorius had impressive performances when he represented the European All-Star team in the MLB Academies Tournament in Barcelona. A select 10 (which included the former Northwood School pupil), were chosen out of 150 players from the African, Italian, French, Czech and Dutch academies. Pretorius, a pitcher, will be travelling with the team to Tennessee and Arizona to participate in the Arizona Fall Classic, where they will face some of the biggest names in college baseball, which is the biggest showcase of youth talent in USA baseball. Pretorius left South Africa on October 2 and will be in Tennessee this week and Arizona on October 10 to 16. “It’s a rare opportunity for a player from South Africa to get a fantastic chance like this. I’m privileged and honoured to have the opportunity to play. It’s an exciting time for me. I’m really looking forward to it. My hope is to do well for the team and hopefully impress some of the pro-scouts who will be at the tournament. For any player in any sport, having a good strong support base is vital and I’m blessed to have my dad, who has always been there for me throughout my baseball career, and my family in my corner,” said Pretorius. The tournament is set to take place later this year. Daily News
