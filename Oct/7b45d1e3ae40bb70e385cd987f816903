Durban - Five people were killed when a tanker crashed head on into a car at ‘Suicide Bend’ along the R102 in Sunwich Port, near Port Shepstone on Friday morning. The truck driver sustained minor injuries. Robert Mckenzie, spokesperson for KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Services said the cause of the crash is yet to be established. In August last year, a truck driver and his passenger were injured after the driver lost control of the truck. Friday's crash comes just days after officials from the Social Development launched a road safety campaign in the district. Weziwe Thusi, KZN Social Development MEC, met with locals for the launch. The campaign was part of the provincial government's initiative to ensure that all vehicles are roadworthy, motorists have valid drivers licence's and are not driving under the influence of alcohol. The campaign also formed part of Transport Month activities. Daily News
