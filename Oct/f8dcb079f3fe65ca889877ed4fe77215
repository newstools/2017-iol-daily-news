Growthpoint Kings Park Stadium is set to host a Currie Cup match between the Sharks and DHL Western Province with kick-off  at 3pm, while Moses Mabhida Stadium is set to host the MTN8 final between Cape Town City and SuperSport United four hours later at 7pm. The rain came down hard in Durban and many sports lovers were keen to find out if they had to make alternative plans over the weekend. The Sharks will be hoping to cement their place at the top of the Currie Cup table when they face second-placed Western Province. On their Twitter page, the Sharks shared a short video of a flooded corridor, which received a reply video showing a flooded tunnel and rain soaked field of play. Novashni Chetty, Sharks PR and communications manager, said: “We did have flooding in certain parts of the stadium.  Apart from minor damage in certain areas we are pleased to advise that there was no structural damage caused.” Chetty said they had a good drainage system in their main field and despite the field being wet, there was no damage to it. Thousands of fans are expected to flock to Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow to watch the clash that would see either coach Benni McCarthy or Eric Tinkler walk away with MTN8 title. Lara McLeod, marketing and communications manager at Moses Mabhida Stadium, said the stadium also had some flooding and rainwater had 
entered shops and the ticket office. “However, due to the fact that Moses Mabhida Stadium has a sand-based pitch to facilitate drainage, the rainwater drained away quickly and effectively once the rain abated,” McLeod said. Daily News
