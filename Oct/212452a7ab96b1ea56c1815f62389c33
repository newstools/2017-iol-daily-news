Morck and Debideen worked together on the design which was worn at the weekend in the national costume parade. “The focus was to create an eye-catching local look with elements that make up our beautiful country,” Morck said. The zebra and leopard print skirt which featured a feathered hemline, a print of President Nelson Mandela, the Big Five, and a map of Africa, was a head-turner. The flesh-coloured top featured Zulu shields with black spots depicting leopard spots, along with a Zulu beaded necklace and bracelets. The back featured two fake rhino horns with hand-stitched SA flags in satin which Debideen swished around dramatically. A zebra print African hat adorned with another shield, feathers in the flag’s colours, and porcupine quills topped off the outfit. The finals of the Miss Grand International take place on October 25.
