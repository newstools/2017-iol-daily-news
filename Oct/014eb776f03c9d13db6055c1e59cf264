Durban - Three women were treated for smoke inhalation after a fire raged through their Sherwood home in the early hours of Friday morning. Gillian Smith, her daughter Ronwynne Young and granddaughter, Shannon Young were asleep when the fire started in their two-storey house. The family’s three dogs, two cats and parrot died after inhaling smoke. Two bearded dragons, two tortoises and fish were unharmed. Trini Reddy, who has been living on the Smith property for just over a year, said he woke up to the sound of glass shattering. “There is a taxi that parks at the side of house. I heard the windows blow out and assumed the taxi was on fire. I walked out of the outbuilding where I live and saw other people from the property walking around. When we looked up, we saw flames coming from the house,” Reddy said.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
