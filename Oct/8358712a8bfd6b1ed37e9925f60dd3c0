Durban - Spring is here and summer is a stone's throw away yet five of Durban’s municipal pools are currently non operational. Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson said out of the 52 pools, five of them are not working. She said that the Rachel Finlayson swimming pool, which is situated along Durban’s beachfront is under rehabilitation. The municipality expects the project to be completed in February 2018. “Umlazi BB Pool requires some repair services to be done. These include the servicing of valves and other fittings, faulty pipeline to be replaced and resealing of the return jet outlets to the pool walls to be done," said Mthethwa. In addition, she said similar work is required at Firwood Road Swimming Pool and funding has been allocated for the project. She also said that the Newlands Pool requires the refurbishment of pipework and tiling. “Repair work of the ceiling at Kings Park Indoor swimming pool is underway after roof sheets and fittings were damaged during strong gale winds in September 2017,” Mthethwa said.
