The centre, set within the confines of the popular zoo, will play a vital role in educating schoolchildren and the public about conservation and the importance of biodiversity. Also at the unveiling was Sri Swami Padmanabhananda, the general secretary of the Divine Life Society in India, and Ishwar Ramlutchman, founder of the Sivananda World Peace Foundation. The king encouraged the city of Durban to look after the zoo. “The youth are our future and this centre will encourage them to protect our wildlife.” At the unveiling, he was given a traditional garment to wear rather than a leopard skin. “I am glad to have contributed to the conservation of leopards,” he said. “It is a historic milestone in the zoo’s history and I am honoured to play my role in nature conservation.” Thembinkosi Ngcobo, the head of eThekwini Parks and Recreation, said 70000 schoolchildren visited the zoo every year. “The centre will make it easier to teach children the A-Z about nature conservation. They will grasp more knowledge from here,” Ngcobo said. Mitchell Park Trust chairman Dr Sanil Singh said the centre would help people understand the importance of balanced, healthy ecosystems and sustainable use of natural resources. The centre will house displays, models and educational material relating to the environment and conservation, highlighting species found in the city. “This could not have been possible, but for the efforts of the  founding trustee and educator, Dhunnram Moolchun, who was able to raise R100000 from an anonymous donor,” Singh said.
