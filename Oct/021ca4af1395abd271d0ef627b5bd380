On Sunday night, their five-star B&B establishment in Haven Road, which they have run since 2003, was finally named the category winner. “I always believed we would clinch the national title one day, and I let out a whelp when our names were announced,” Emma said last. As in previous years, the Jacobs and their nine-bedroomed B&B were provincial winners, which qualified them for the national competition, run by South African Tourism to recognise and reward “exemplary service”. The awards are adjudicated through public votes and by a panel of industry judges. The Westville B&B was up against competition from three other finalists. It has been awarded Trip Advisor certificates for excellence for four years and is Trip Advisor’s No1 B&B in the Westville area and No2 in the whole of Durban, Emma said. Other KZN winners were: the Azalea B&B (three-star B&B category); Qabuleka B&B (two-star B&B category); Hawklee Country House (three-star country house category); Garden Court uMhlanga (three-star hotel category); The Gorge Private Game Lodge & Spa (five-star lodge category); Nselweni Bush Lodge (two-star self-catering exclusive category); and Sodwana Bay Resort (two-star self-catering shared vacation category).
