They would remain suspended until the Department of Public Works secured the environment and made it safe for the people and the equipment, Colonel Barney Fourie, the officer commanding Air Force Base Durban, said. Both hangars had holes in their roofs and there were sheets of dangling corrugated iron which would go flying in the next strong gale-force wind “and that was a big risk”, he said. About R3million of “severe” damage was done to the hangars as winds of 120km/*  and torrential rain struck. Roofs were ripped off, a gaping hole was gouged in the side of one hangar, adjacent offices were lost and computers and paperwork damaged. “Fortunately, no aircraft was damaged and no one was injured,” said Fourie, whose car did not escape the devastation. It was parked under a carport, which collapsed on top of it. The aircraft have been moved into one hangar. Now, a disaster committee is to be set up and an inventory of the damage and losses will be drawn up, with the first priority being to safeguard equipment in the offices which have had their roofs ripped off. “It’s a crisis. Rehousing people will be a big process and we might have to rent mobile homes,” Fourie said. There had once been plans to relocate the air force base to King Shaka International Airport, but “that’s not a reality”, he said. “There are a lot of other places that need the money (instead),” Fourie said. With the original plan being to relocate to King Shaka International Airport, all maintenance at the base south of Durban had stopped in 2009. But when it was realised that the move would not happen, the decision was made to focus on making the base more operational again. The plans included recladding the hangars, but now the storm has presented a major setback to that project. With no insurance on government buildings, the state will have to bear the full cost of repairs. Daily News
