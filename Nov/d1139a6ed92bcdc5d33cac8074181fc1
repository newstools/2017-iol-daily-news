Recalling the youth of 1976 who protested against being forced to learn Afrikaans, the pupils said Zulu, a second additional language subject, gave them better chances of passing the exams. Excitement was etched all over their faces when they spoke to the Daily News after the two-hour paper. About 100 matric pupils at the school wrote the exam. Most found the paper to be easy and they predicted scoring an A. Nontobeko Nkosi and Portia Pewo said it was the easiest paper they had written so far, while Mbulelo Ngubane and Nosipho Ngcobo said they found the paper to be average and were confident of a pass. Sinenhlanhla Magwaza said it made sense for him to study his mother tongue because he spoke the language more often than other languages. “For me it is important to know my mother tongue perfectly. I am proud of it and I think it would not be right to have it excluded from my choice of subjects. I read a lot of Zulu books, and they helped me perfect the language,” he said. Sinenhlanhla said he was lucky to have the freedom to study indigenous languages. Exams in Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele were also written at various schools in the country yesterday. Nomfundo Dlamini said she chose Zulu to improve her mother tongue because English was the language she often used at home. “I learnt a lot about my mother tongue in the Zulu class, (more) than I did at home,” she said. Mbali Mnyandu, whose official language is Sotho, said her grandmother who spoke Zulu had motivated her to learn the language. “I wanted to learn more about the language and my grandmother’s culture, and be able to communicate with her fluently,” said Mbali. Natifa Wornyo said it was good that more and more pupils at her school were choosing Zulu. “The Zulu paper was extremely enjoyable. We were not stressed at all, like we were after writing other papers. I cannot wait for my results,” 
she said. Daily News
