Caesar Madlala, 43, was talking to community members when he was attacked by a man who had been part of the meeting. Community members then allegedly attacked the man who had stabbed Madlala. The incident has left Madlala’s family fearing for their lives. Madlala’s brother, who asked not to be named, fearing for his safety, said on Sunday afternoon he received a number of calls from community members saying his brother had been stabbed. Not wanting to believe what he had been told, he went to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital,  fearing the worst. When he got there, he saw his brother’s body, which had suffered multiple stab wounds. “As an older brother it is hard on me - my younger brother died.” The last time he talked to Madlala was a few hours before he died. They had talked about reconnecting electricity to their home after it was cut during the heavy rains that hit the province last month. “We agreed we would talk after the community meeting.” This was the last time they spoke. The meeting was a routine monthly meeting that addressed community issues. Vision Another relative, who also asked not to be named, said Madlala was the founder of the informal settlement, which was why it was named after him. “He loved the place. He had a vision that it would become a nice area to live in one day and always preached about unity in the community,” she said. Madlala had also operated a tuck shop in the area. “He was a good-hearted person and loved people,” the relative said. He leaves behind a four-year-old daughter. Madlala’s brother said the funeral would be held on Saturday. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala csaid: “The motive is unknown at this stage. A case of murder was opened at Lamontville police station for investigation,” Gwala said. “A 21-year-old man was allegedly assaulted by members of the community and was taken to hospital in critical condition. At this stage it’s unclear whether he is linked to the murder or not,” she said. Daily News
