During a press briefing held in Durban on Wednesday, ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma said the existence of the committee came as rumours to the PEC. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Pandor as his preferred deputy should he be elected as the ANC president at the party’s national conference next month. She ­accepted the position. Ramaphosa’s campaigners in KZN told the media during a press briefing on Monday that the national executive committee had at the weekend told them about the 10-member committee to resolve the BGM disputes. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa on Wednesday confirmed the committee. However, at a press briefing in Durban on Wednesday, Zuma said nothing had been officially communicated to the PEC, although he had heard that the ANC national working committee had established the committee to deal with the appeals. The journalists wanted Zuma’s reaction to Pandor’s appointment to head the committee after she had been nominated as Ramaphosa’s deputy. “The PEC will only comment about that decision if it is confirmed. I won’t attempt to deal with issues that have not been properly communicated with us,” Zuma said. He insisted that the PEC was the one to deal with BGM appeals. He said he had been communicating with the NEC on various matters of the national conference, but not about the committee. KZN spokesperson for the Ramaphosa campaign, Sthembiso Mshengu, said his camp had been told by the NEC about the existence of the ­committee. Kodwa said all provinces had been allocated dispute resolution teams comprising NEC members to deal with “appeals/disputes” referred to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe. “The KZN team is convened by Comrade Naledi Pandor,” he said.
