The announcement is expected to take place in London on Wednesday, Ramaphosa’s acting spokesperson Tyrone Seale said. Ramaphosa led the Rugby World Cup Bid Team SA in September when it presented its case to host the 2023 tournament - 200 years after the invention of the game of rugby by William Webb Ellis. The South African bid was subsequently  named the “clear leader” and “unanimous” choice of the RWC board. This followed an exhaustive tendering, clarification, and evaluation process. Contenders France and Ireland were rated second and third respectively. “The final decision rests with 26 World Rugby Council members who collectively exercise 39 votes and among whom a simple majority is required to secure the hosting rights. The three bidding countries do not vote,” Seale said. Those eligible to vote in the secret ballot on November 15 are: Australia (3 votes), England (3), New Zealand (3), Scotland (3), Wales (3), Italy (3), Argentina (3), Canada (1), Japan (2), Georgia (1), Romania (1), USA (1), Asia Rugby (2), Oceania Rugby (2), Rugby Africa (2), Rugby Americas North (2), Rugby Europe (2), and Sudamerica Rugby (2). The announcement was scheduled for about 3pm South African time on Wednesday, and would be broadcast live on SuperSport (Channel 201) from 2.30pm as well as being live streamed by worldrugby.org Ramaphosa’s participation and leadership in this visit would again demonstrate the government's support for and commitment to the effort to return the tournament to the African continent in the 21st century, the Presidency said. The high-powered delegation would include Sport and Recreation Minister Thulas Nxesi, SA Rugby president Mark Alexander, and chief executive officer Jurie Roux. - ANA
