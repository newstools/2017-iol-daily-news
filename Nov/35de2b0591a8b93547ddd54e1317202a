He made the claims after it emerged that the presidential hopeful and his wife, May Mashego, whose name was also not on the roll, did not participate in the crucial process that includes deciding on the leadership to be elected at the ANC’s elective conference next month. “I heard rumours that the TG and his wife will not appear on the roll. I went to the branch general meeting with a copy of TG’s membership that he took in 2014 April. May joined with R100 in 2016 and 2017. Their membership is valid until 2019 and 2022,” he explained. But Sbu said both names did not appear on the roll and no satisfactory explanation was given. “They are members in good standing, they renew membership and pay for five years to eliminate mistakes,” he added. He produced party membership proof for Mashego, confirming his claims but had not sent one for Zweli by the time of going to print. He said that at the branch it often occurred that Mkhize family members were sidelined from BGMs and annual meetings, something he claimed to have taken up with the provincial leadership before. “I told them I would lodge a dispute as an ANC member and a Mkhize family member as this systematic exclusion of my relatives has occurred previously. I am drafting a letter as we speak,” he added. Zweli confirmed the news. “I attended the last branch executive meeting in preparation for policy conference; our names were in (the roll). Today they are removed,” he said. Sbu said Zweli’s son, Dedani Mkhize’s name had also been “removed” from the roll. Dedani expressed his displeasure on Facebook: “The membership of Dr Zweli Mkhize and his wife Dr May Mashego has been removed from the branch membership roll. Factionalists can be this bold and get away with it. Welcome to KZN, Moses Mabhida Region, where gatekeeping is a name of a game and factionalism is celebrated as being bold.” Daily News
