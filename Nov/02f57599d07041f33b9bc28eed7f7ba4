The brochures have already been printed for the 2018/19 cruise season, for holidays aboard the MSC Musica, which can carry 3223 passengers and which has 16 decks, more swimming pools than the current MSC Sinfonia, more cabins and more entertainment. The arrival of MSC Musica, in early November 2018, will cater for the increased demand for cruises. “We are already moving more than 100000 local passengers every six-month season,” said Ross Volk, managing director of MSC Cruises South Africa. MSC is also in a joint venture with Africa Armada Consortium and their KZN Cruise Terminal has already been named the preferred bidder for the R100million Durban Cruise Terminal. The terminal will be able to take two vessels at the same time and the project will create employment during construction and operation phases. MSC began a concerted drive to employ more South Africans - both in local waters and worldwide - in 2013. The numbers for on-board and land-based jobs have increased over the years, and South Africans are now employed in a wide variety of jobs, from housekeepers, waiters, shore excursion hosts, shop assistants, casino dealers as well as cruise directors. “MSC Musica will drive ­local employment opportunities even further, with a need for a total crew of just over 1000,” Volk said.
