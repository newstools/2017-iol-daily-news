The convoy of bikes set off from the Pavilion for the Lords and Legends venue at the eManzimtoti sports field yesterday morning, but some 30 minutes later, Rescue Care paramedics who had been helping with the event, were called back along the south-bound route to an accident on the N2 just after the M7 off-ramp. They found a rider, who had been travelling with toys on his bike like fellow riders, lying in the median, said Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care’s operations director. “He had suffered major injuries. “Advanced life support paramedics attempted to resuscitate him at the scene. However, after about 30 minutes, he was declared dead,” Jamieson said. The second accident happened on the return N2 northbound journey before the M7, where paramedics found that a bike and a car had collided. The biker sustained minor injuries and he was stabilised before being taken to hospital. The Toy Run is South Africa’s largest motorcycle charity event. It is held in at least 19 centres across the country, with the bikes sporting toys and teddy bears, which will be distributed to children in homes and elsewhere. Daily News
