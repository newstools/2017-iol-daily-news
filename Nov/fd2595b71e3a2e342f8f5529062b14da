Department spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said the campaign was a joint project with eThekwini Municipality. “The aim is to hand over title deeds to bona fide beneficiaries. For now, we have employed social facilitators who are doing house visits with a questionnaire to determine the true owners before handing over title deeds,” Baloyi explained. He said that the campaign, which began last year, was a cumbersome process. Nhlanhlenhle Mnguni, a resident in Klaarwater, Mariannhill, said he and other community members feared that people might claim ownership of the houses. “We have renovated these houses with hopes that one day we will be 
recognised as the rightful owners. Other community members have resorted to selling while those who retained the houses have repeatedly been met with electricity and water bills which reflected untrue amounts,” Mnguni said. Ward 17 councillor Sibusiso Cedrick Khwela said the problem of ownership was complex and cautioned people not to be misled. “There was a swamp where houses were built. That area was unsuitable for any construction,” Khwela said. He said that houses were built by a private contractor who failed to be present at meetings. Residents often complained about small bedrooms, he said. According to the Human Settlements Department, one of the key provisions for the housing system was that a beneficiary may occupy an RDP house for up to five years before receiving the title deeds.
