Harrielall, of Escombe, had applied for admission to the MBChB programme at UKZN in 2015, but her application was unsuccessful. She then enrolled for a Bachelor of Medical Science (anatomy) degree with the hope of improving her chances of being admitted to the MBChB programme the following year. Upon applying again under UKZN’s “mature students” policy, her application was 
unsuccessful because space for first-year students was limited. She then decided to take the legal route and launched a review application with the High Court in Pietermaritzburg in an attempt to have the decision not to be accepted at the institution set aside. UKZN opposed the application on the grounds that she had been considered alongside 160 other candidates and had not made it into the list of top 10 applicants who had qualified for places. Policy The high court dismissed her application on the grounds that she had failed to show that the relevant admission policy was not applied in refusing her application. Harrielall then approached the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), seeking leave to appeal against the high court dismissal; there again her application was dismissed. She then turned to the Constitutional Court. On Tuesday, the court after considering written submissions by both parties, said it was satisfied that her application must fail as it bore no prospects of success. The court found that the UKZN’s admission policy was applied correctly, and that Harrielall’s application was unsuccessful because she had been competing with other candidates who had been more qualified in admission requirements and scored higher than her. Harrielall’s lawyers were on Tuesday unavailable to comment on the judgment. UKZN said it was satisfied with the judgment in that it confirmed that the application of the medical school admission policy was fair and correct in determining Harrielall’s application. Daily News
