A group that spoke to the Daily News last night believe that President Robert Mugabe, his wife Grace and their two sons should be investigated and prosecuted if there was evidence of any wrongdoing. Jacob Mudenda, Speaker of Parliament in Zimbabwe, Tuesday  afternoon announced that Mugabe had resigned. Many Zimbabweans at home and in neighbouring countries, including South Africa, celebrated the news of the 93-year-old president’s resignation late into the night. Although many have welcomed Mugabe’s resignation, Zimbabweans say there are still many questions concerning what will happen to Mugabe and his family and what the future holds for their country. “The old man has overstayed his welcome and he and his family remained in charge by instilling fear in the starving Zimbabweans... The question is what deal have they made to have him resign,” Prosper Muskwe said. “He destroyed the once-rich country in the SADC region. His sons lead rich lives at the expense of poor Zimbabweans,” Muskwe said. A group of Zimbabweans on the streets of Durban last night said Mugabe should remain in Zimbabwe and face the people he had tormented and treated like “donkeys”. He must be charged for crimes against humanity, said the group interviewed by the Daily News. Daily News
