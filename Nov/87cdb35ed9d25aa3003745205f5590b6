And the people Dr Don Thomas had met during his visit to the city were also beautiful, he told his spellbound audience. The lights he had seen over the city during some of his 700 orbits of Earth, were probably the audience sitting up at night studying, he said to laughter. Thomas was visiting Durban as part of a Living Maths Tour of the country, and the special event at the Natural Science Museum was in collaboration with the US Consulate in Durban and the eThekwini municipality. Living Maths is a Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths)-based NGO. Thomas told how he had been on four space missions, had spent 446 days in space, seeing 16 sunsets and 16 sunrises every day, and had travelled at 28 000km/* . It took just 90 minutes to orbit Earth. Four seconds after lift-off, Thomas and his crewmates were travelling at 200km/*  and in eight-and-half minutes, they were in space. “It took me longer to find the museum today,” grinned the mission specialist, who carried out experiments in space. And like other pupils across South Africa, his curious Durban audience wanted to know all about the toilet arrangements on board the space shuttles. And what about aliens, they asked? He believed there was other life out there in the universe, but it had not been seen yet. The inspirational rocket man praised the Durban pupils for their good questions and singled out 12-year-old Phiwayinkosi “TJ” Shezi from StTheresa’s Primary School, who got the chance to try on some real space gloves and a helmet.
