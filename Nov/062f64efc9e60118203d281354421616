The DVDs and CDs were seized during raids conducted by FPB compliance officers in partnership with the SAPS, Electronic Crime Investigation and South African Federation Against Copyright Theft. The DVDs set aside for destruction are from exhibits of concluded court cases. Various raids were conducted by the Durban Compliance Monitoring team in Durban Central, Pietermaritzburg, Pinetown, Port Shepstone, Isipingo and Montclair, with the majority of confiscated material coming from Durban Central. Prevent Acting Chief Operations Officer Abongile Mashele said:.  “The destruction process is conducted purely to prevent the confiscated DVDs and CDs from finding their way back to the market. “Most of the confiscated material was unclassified and contained pornographic material which were sold on the streets and taxi ranks, which carries the risk of exposing children to harmful material,” said Mashele. The confiscated items consisted of a large percentage of Hollywood and local content, and a small percentage of Nollywood, Bollywood and pornography titles. The Films and Publications Act 65 of 1996, as amended prohibits the distribution 
of unclassified films and 
games. The act further requires the classification to be clearly and conspicuously displayed, the failure of which could render one liable upon prosecution to a period of imprisonment 
of up to six months, a fine or both. Daily News
