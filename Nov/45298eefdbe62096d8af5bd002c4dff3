Durban - It was a case of being in the right place at the right time for Durban police officers and law enforcement officials when they nabbed a man allegedly stealing a Toyota Fortuner in Berea on Friday morning. The event unfolded on St Thomas Road. Officers were gathered at Berea Park when they heard gunshots coming from the road nearby and raced to the scene. According to a police official, a group of men were seen tampering with the Fortuner. "The owner was seated nearby and someone alerted him to what was happening. As the man approached his van, the suspects fired shots in his direction. He drew his firearm and fired back. The men managed to get into the Fortuner and drove away. The driver mounted the van on the curb of Vause and Windmill roads, near the Durban High School. One of the gang members was arrested at the scene," the source said. The Fortuner was recovered and two other men fled the scene. Berea Police are investigating further. Police along with members from the local Community Policing Forum and private security firms were at the park to commence clean up operations in the area.Â
