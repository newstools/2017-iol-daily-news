According to a report tabled at an exco sitting at the city hall on Tuesday, the repairs were deemed urgent, to mitigate the threat to life, property and additional cost from consequential damages and to restore essential services. While many parts of eThekwini were affected by the storm, the southern areas were said to be the worst affected. Such areas include eManzimtoti, KwaDabeka, parts of uMlazi, Isipingo, Montclair, Jacobs, Clairwood, Bluff, Chesterville, Malvern, Queensburgh, Glenwood. The estimated total cost for the already identified emergency and urgent projects is just over R308m and, depending on the outcome of the engagement between the provincial and the National treasury, some funds may be provided to eThekwini for emergency work.

The DA leader in KZN, Zwakele Mncwango, commenting on a different agenda item - the youth programme planned for R25m - asked: “Economically is it logical to spend this amount of money for the programme?

About 2 000 people are homeless and hundreds of shacks were washed away,” Mncwango protested. eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede said this report was speaking to the next phase of addressing the storm damage. ANC councillor Barbara Fortein said: “We have been doing these programmes so I say let’s just push ahead. We need to empower women, we need to empower the youth and these programmes will do that. They are not just one-day events,” she said. Daily News
