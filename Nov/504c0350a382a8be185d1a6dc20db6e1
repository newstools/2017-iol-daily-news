A day you may never forget, memories you may never lose or gifts you may never want to share will available at the Santa Run. The inaugural edition of the Santa Run is to take place on November 25 at Growth Point Kings Park Stadium (outer fields). Ever had dreams of meeting the Cell C Sharks squad, wondered what their dressing room looked like, or just how big it is? Worry not, the Santa Run, a Kid Zone initiative with the Daily News, will make all your dreams come true. The first of its kind in South Africa, Santa Run aims at creating a welcoming environment filled with fun activities where families can exercise together in the 5 km fun run / walk. The half-day family event starting at 9am will feature activities for children and adults. Participants could look forward to live marimba music, food and drinks stalls, face painting and a dedicated children’s play area with inflatables. Aakash Bramdeo, Editor of the Daily News, encourages families to come in their numbers to enjoy themselves. “I’m looking forward to the inaugural Santa Run. It’s a wonderful opportunity for families to come together for a bit of fun and exercise,” said Bramdeo. Bronwyn Fynn, who is in involved with national events at Independent Media, also urged readers to participate. “I encourage everybody to put on their running shoes and have fun,” said Fynn. Registration is from 7am until 8.45am. Pre-event entries cost R120 per person and includes a gift, Santa hat and a ­Christmas cracker, while on-day entries are R140 a person. Participants can look forward to entertainment by ­celebrity DJ Jane Linley Thomas, who will keep everybody at the event informed, entertained and in good spirits before the fun run begins. Daily News
