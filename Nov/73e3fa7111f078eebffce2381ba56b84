After registering my children, Vittal, 6, and Keshav, 2, for the 5km family walk. I  instantly received an e-mail  from online toy store and the event’s sponsor, The Kid Zone. In a matter of days I was notified that the boys’  gifts had been dispatched. An SMS on the day of delivery notified me that the parcel would arrive that day, informed me of the courier vehicle to expect and even provided the driver’s name. The big boxes were filled with gender-neutral, mentally stimulating toys. The experience dispelled numerous myths of a negative nature I had heard about online shopping. In addition to the gifts, there is the anticipation of meeting Sharkie and other families at the end of the month. The Santa Run is a global concept, with walks held in numerous countries across the world. People dress up in Santa suits - or at least, in Durban’s heat, wear Santa hats. The fun event promotes positive family lifestyle values - and that feel-good Christmas vibe. Everyone who registers for the run gets a free gift. Children aged 3-12 will receive a toy and 13+ will receive a gift voucher from The Kid Zone. Enter via http:/santarun.roag.org/ There is a 15% discount for family bookings of three or more. Tickets cost R120 a person, including your free gift. For more information
