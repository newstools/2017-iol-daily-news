Judge Gregory Wright was questioning advocate Hilton Epstein during the application brought by Freedom Under Law (FUL) to order President Jacob Zuma to constitute an inquiry into the pair. “The minister of justice conveyed a message from Mr Abrahams to the president that the two advocates were performing their functions well What do you say about the quality of the opinion of Mr Abrahams that advocates Jiba and Mrwebi were performing well given the nature of the judicial findings against them?” Epstein responded: “His view was that although there was criticism, it was not sufficient to suspend them.” Judge Billy Mothle asked Epstein when Zuma knew about the judge’s remarks against the two advocates. Epstein said Zuma might have known about the matter after the DA wrote him a letter. The General Council of the Bar applied to have the pair removed. He said Zuma wanted to act after the decision by the bar council as he was aware that they had already brought an application to court. The bar council brought a case against the pair because their handling of cases including dropping charges against suspended head of police crime intelligence Richard Mdluli, the prosecution of Zuma on corruption charges, and of suspended KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen. On Monday, Freedom Under Law advocate Max du Plessis told the court that Zuma delayed in instituting an inquiry into the fitness of Jiba and Mrwebi, despite notifying him about the matter. FUL wants the court to declare Zuma’s failure to institute an inquiry into Jiba and Mrwebi’s conduct as unlawful and to direct the president to institute such an inquiry. Judgment was reserved. - ANA
