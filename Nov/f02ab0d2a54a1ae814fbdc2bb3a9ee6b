Eleven years later, the site has been dubbed one of KwaZulu-Natal`s most awesome natural phenomena. The Mount Moreland Conservancy has also become South Africa’s largest roost site. And on Sunday, the public is invited to view the migration spectacle. Wilken, chairperson of the Mount Moreland Conservancy, said that as spring arrived in September, the migratory barn swallows begin to appear. “The initial, small flocks swell to thousands and then millions. By November, three- to five million barn swallows can be seen every evening over the Lake Victoria wetland roost,” Wilken said. March is equally spectacular as they mass and prepare for the migration back to Europe. Their flight is flirtatious, they show off their new feathers and chirp, full of excitement at the prospect of their 10 000km journey. From as far back as the 1970s, the birds have been admired for the mass evening displays at Mount Moreland, but it was through the formation of the conservancy that they were drawn into the spotlight. In the 1990s, the conservancy began an annual event called “The return of the swallows”, and over years of trial and error it became more recognised and supported. By 2005, the number of swallow watchers had noticeably increased and there was a craving for more knowledge. Prem Gurney, manager of Umdloti Estate, and Paul Russell, Tongaat Hulett regional manager: agriculture, welcomed the proposal to open the Lake Victoria site. A partnership was formed among Tongaat Hulett, Airports Company South Africa, Birdlife and the Mount Moreland Conservancy.
