Durban - Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC has expressed his worry and concern after learning that there are low levels of blood at the South African National Blood Service (SANBS). This comes after Dhlomo met with management of SANBS. Dhlomo said, “I actually got very shocked to learn that their levels have gone down to just a day’s supply hence this appeal to all healthy South Africans to please come forward and donate. We actually would appreciate if students at tertiary institutions can spare us just a pint each before they dispatch to their homes for their festive vacations.” The MEC said since KZN attracts many holidaymakers during December and January, it also experiences a higher number of injuries from accidents. “We can all assist those who might get involved in road accidents but manage to live because we have given them a second chance by donating blood. As we call it a gift of life, those who get this gift are able to really live even longer.” Dhlomo has also decided to play a role in increasing the levels of blood in the province by also giving a pint of blood. The SANBS has said that most blood is needed for patients who are terminally ill and rely on daily, if not weekly transfusions in order to survive as well as women who had complications during childbirth. Donor checklist:
Weigh at least 50kg
Be between the ages of 16-65
Lead a safe sexual lifestyle
Your blood is safe for transfusion to a patient
