The Hyper by the Sea in Durban North has been serving customers since 1978.  This is the first Hyper to relaunch as part of Pick n Pay’s Next Generation project, which provides customers with comprehensive product ranges, open and easy-to-navigate spaces, and a host of value-added services - all developed to create the most efficient and enjoyable customer experience.  Speaking at the launch, Kevin Goosen, the store’s general manager, said they looked forward to welcoming their regular customers and shoppers from all over Durban.  “We have created an inviting, vibrant space that’s alive with colourful innovation, top-of-the-line products, and the freshest produce and concepts,” he said.  According to Pick n Pay, the Hyper will take the Next Generation concept to a new level, offering the best food experience possible.  Every aspect of the store has been upgraded or enhanced, and it carries a wider variety of hand-picked products catering to the needs of its customers.  Daily News
