Allan Hirsch, chief executive of Hirsch’s, said Friday’s trading, both online and in-store, exceeded their expectations. “People are investing in themselves and in their homes, and this is so encouraging as it shows confidence in the business community in South Africa,” he said. Dr Christoph Nieuwoudt, chief executive of FNB Consumer, said: “Black Friday is a trend that is definitely gaining momentum across consumers and retailers.” He added it was too early to quantify the impact and the general consumer experience. While Black Friday had been seen as a foreign concept, this idea was fading as both consumers and retailers were capitalising on the phenomenon. The long queues at shopping malls showed that consumers who did not plan their shopping experience might not have got all the goods they wanted because they would have spent a significant amount of time waiting in queues. Queue Bongiwe Majola was one of the customers who had to wait hours in the queue. “I was at Ackermans and I waited for two hours,’ she said. Majola said most of  the clothes had been taken by early shoppers. Larger-than-expected volumes hit online retailer Takealot hard. Its site and app crashed because of overwhelming numbers of people scouring its websites for the best deals. In a statement posted on its Facebook page, Takealot said: “The Takealot.com website and apps are temporarily down due to overwhelming volumes We’re so sorry for disappointing any customers who are busy shopping this Black Friday, and we’ll have you back shopping as soon as possible.” This was much to the annoyance of many customers. Online shopper Brett Teichmann posted on the company’s Facebook page: “What a waste of time! Stayed up late so that we could access the site at midnight, then it went down. Clearly not great planning knowing there would be a huge influx!  Very poor and very disappointing. Has put me off this Black Friday shopping.” Daily News
