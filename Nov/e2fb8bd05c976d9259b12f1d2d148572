The guard, who works for a vehicle storage facility, was taken to hospital where his hand was successfully reattached after a 15-hour surgery. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele  said security guards were at the facility in Eddie Hagan Drive early on Friday morning when they were accosted by men carrying firearms and a bush knife. “The suspects amputated a security guard’s hand and fled with the CCTV cameras, cellphones and laptops. The guard was taken to hospital. “A case of business robbery and attempted murder was opened at Inchanga police station for investigation,” she said. Despite an extensive search of the area, no arrests had been made. Llewellyn Joyce, a spokesperson for LAD Security, said the guard was doing well and recovering in hospital. “One of the guards managed to hit the panic button. Owing to the police investigation, I cannot say much more. “I can confirm that the cable ties saved him from bleeding out. The support we received from the police and ambulance services was overwhelming. The fact that his hand was saved shows the effort emergency teams put in,” Joyce said. Daily News
