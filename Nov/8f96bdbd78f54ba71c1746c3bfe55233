Durban - Motorists are urged to avoid Clare Road in Clare Estate, after a large mob of residents blocked the road. The crowd is from the nearby Foreman Road informal settlement. Residents burnt piles of rubbish on the road. The protest comes days after hundreds of residents were displaced during a fire at the settlement at the weekend.
On Sunday morning, residents woke up to screams and the smell of smoke after a candle fell over, setting one of the shacks alight. The fire spread quickly, leaving scores of residents scrambling to gather their personal belongings. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
