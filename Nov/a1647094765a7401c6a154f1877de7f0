Bheki Doctor Magwaza, 47, of Waterloo, Verulam, a security guard who raped his victims while in uniform, was sentenced in the Durban High Court on Tuesday. His reign of terror spanned eight years, from September 2008 to February last year, when he targeted couples in Waterloo and neighbouring areas. “The accused would instruct the couple at gunpoint to have sex in front of him and when they refused, he threatened the men and raped the women,” said police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. The incidents were reported to the Verulam SAPS and transferred to the Phoenix Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit, with members from the KZN and national investigative psychology section helping to track down Magwaza. One victim was able to take down the number plate of the car used by her rapist, which helped to trace him. Major-General Bheki Langa, the KZN acting provincial commissioner, said he hoped the heavy sentence would send a message to other perpetrators. He commended the forensic team for hunting down the rapist. And in the Nqutu Regional Court on Tuesday, another rapist, Thabani Buthelezi, 20, was sent to prison for 15 years, along with another eight years for robbery. In the attack four years ago, his victim was raped at knifepoint and robbed of her cellphone. She was three months’ pregnant at the time of the attack. Daily News
