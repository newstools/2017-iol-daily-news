The REC member, who spoke with Independent Media on condition of anonymity, said wards 10 and 14 were meant to have held their BGMs on Wednesday, however the official deployed to administer the meetings had gone missing. The REC member said ward 10’s BGM, in Pennington near Scottburgh, on Sunday had been disrupted as there were four changes of venue without the branch secretary’s knowledge. “I was deployed by the regional secretary to observe the processes at the meeting, but when I got there, one of the deployees disrupted the meeting,” she said. The Lower South Coast region is hoping to conclude all its meetings by Sunday, but will require special permission to do so. Meanwhile, more than three quarters of the ANC’s KZN branches had managed to hold their branch general meetings, spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said on Wednesday. Ntuli said 630 branches had held their meetings and that by Wednesday Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma was in the lead. Daily News
