Crackertoa and the CHOC Cows will join The Kid Zone, Sharks players, Sharkie, Jane Linley-Thomas and Fireman Sam. Crackertoa will sponsor The Santa Run with 1 200 crackers. Crackertoa has changed the way Christmas meals are celebrated. At the pull of the cracker and a loud bang, a shower of confetti engulfs the air and floats gently down on the family. “It is that explosive moment when the unexpected visual surprise happens that makes the occasion so memorable,” said Miles Rasmussen, director at Glenart Trading. Crackertoa was “conceived, designed and manufactured” in South Africa, but is also receiving international acclaim. “Last week, a review by a panel of experts from The Independent, a leading UK publication, voted Crackertoa ‘the best cracker buy in Britain for 2017’,” said Rasmussen. The Cows, who raise funds for CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation in South Africa, will man the water table at the Santa Run. These funds are raised through sporting events. The Cows was started in 2008 by a group of eight enthusiastic cyclists who wanted to make a difference. Cordi van Niekerk, one of the founder members, joined Kerrin and Grant Bain in cycling the 94.7 Cycle Challenge in memory of their daughter, Jessica, who had died of cancer at 20 months. CHOC had played a big role in the Bain family in the last few weeks of Jessica’s life, so they decided to make CHOC the beneficiary of their pursuit and wore cow suits. They raised R230 000. Years later and The Cows have raised more than R30 million. These funds help CHOC make a difference to children being treated for cancer in South Africa. Daily News
