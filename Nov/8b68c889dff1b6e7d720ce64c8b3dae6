These measures include staying indoors and off the roads (where possible), avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped within a vehicle by rising waters, abandon it immediately and seek higher ground. Residents living in informal settlements are also advised to secure their roof sheeting,” said Mthethwa. According to Wayne Venter of SAWS, these weather conditions can lead to disruptive and disastrous conditions. Venter said cold weather will invade the Eastern Cape, southern KZN, southern Free State and the Northern Cape on Wednesday, spreading to reach the remainder of KZN, the Free State, Gauteng and Mpumalanga on Thursday, accompanied by maximum temperatures in the mid teens. However, very cold weather, characterized by single digit maximum temperatures (+9 °C or less), will dominate high-lying areas of the Eastern Cape and south-western KZN on Thursday. Light snowfall is also expected to spread to the south-western and western high ground of KZN.
