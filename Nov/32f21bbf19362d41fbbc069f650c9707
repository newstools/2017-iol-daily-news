During the tabling of the monthly report on awards made by the city for August, IFP councillor Mdu Nkosi threw down the gauntlet to city manager Sipho Nzuza, calling on him to look into companies linked to suspended city officials who are still doing business with the municipality. “City manager, I have evidence and I have seen suspended officials at the car park leaving with documents. The companies they are linked with are still doing business with the city, and I will furnish you with that information after the meeting. Deal with this urgently, lest we end up questioning your integrity” Nkosi told Nzuza. The Mercury, the Daily News’s sister paper, recently reported that in April, Nkosi had requested the Office of the Public Protector to investigate allegations of municipal officials awarding tenders to companies owned by their friends and relatives. At the time, Cleopatra Mosina, spokesperson for the Public Protector’s Office, said the matter had not been finalised. On Thursday, Nkosi told the Daily News he had challenged the city manager to act because one of the suspended officials was a senior supply chain management official. “The ANC councillors were mum because I was giving them facts. I gave them all the details before, yet I still see some of these companies getting contracts from the city,” he said. Nzuza said all the allegations were attended to. Daily News
