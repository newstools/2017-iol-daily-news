Melissa and Katherine, who are in the same Grade12 class at Durban Girls’ High School in Glenwood, were speaking to the Daily News soon after writing Afrikaans Paper 1, language and comprehension, on Thursday. They both found the Afrikaans paper easy and enjoyable. “Afrikaans is not difficult, it’s actually the easiest of all the subjects,” said Melissa. The twins have been inseparable, but will study at different institutions next 
year. Unable to decide exactly who is the smartest, the bubbly girls said while one would score a few marks higher at certain subjects, Melissa admitted that Katherine usually beat her. They said they always did the same subjects. No matter how hard they tried to study individually, they enjoyed reading aloud to each other just to make sure that they understood the work. The sisters said they had always shared a bedroom until Melissa moved to another room last December. “We now have separate bedrooms, but would often find one creeping in on the other to ask for assistance or clarity,” said Katherine. Their study patterns differed. While Melissa said she preferred studying early in the morning, Katherine studied right through the night and went to bed at about 2am. Katherine said: “Eating a healthy and balanced diet of high protein foods, dried fruit and double cream yoghurt helps us keep strong for our rock-climbing hobby and also works for us during exams, to keep alert and energised.” The twins also had a chance to go over the Afrikaans paper with a group of friends afterwards. Yashna Lilram said the paper was good and although there were some difficult 
parts, she was confident of a pass. Andiswa Nzimande, who also did French and planned to study law next year, said the languages would assist her to communicate well in her field of work. Sarah Suleman said she had enjoyed the comprehension section of the paper. “I really enjoyed the paper. It covered everything I had 
expected and prepared for,” said Sarah. Daily News
