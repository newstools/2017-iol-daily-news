The trucking company dug a T-shaped trench on the premises close to their front gate. The trench stopped at the gate. The pavement was dug up outside the gate to form a canal so that oil and water could flow from the trench on to the road. The incident has left local environmental groups fuming. Shaun Hammond, Silverglen Conservancy group spokesperson, said: “This is by far the worst form of pollution I have seen in the area. They intentionally dug the trench into the ground leading to the pavement.” Thasi Govender, co-tenant of the property, said a drum filled with oil had fallen over into the trench which had initially been filled with rainwater. “I rushed to the property when I was notified of the pollution. “We have a protocol to use a 210-litre drum on the property. Oil drained from trucks goes into a filter and into the drum. We sell the used oil to a company on a weekly basis,” Govender said. He was fined R5000 for illegal dumping of waste oil. The municipality wastewater management and pollution unit also issued him with a warning and made Govender clean up the mess immediately to prevent it from entering the stormwater drain. He was warned he would have to rehabilitate the affected area and have a safe disposal certificate available for inspection. Tony Govender, the ward councillor, said the 10m trench had been deliberately dug. “Black pools of oil could be seen around the property.” Hammond said he would pursue the matter, ensure the land was rehabilitated and involve the Department of Environmental Affairs’ green scorpions. “This area is a catchment area 400m from the nature reserve. It is the only green lung Chatsworth has,” he said. Daily News
