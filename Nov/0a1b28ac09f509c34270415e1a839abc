Durban - With #BlackFriday finally here, the Daily News team headed out to local shopping centres to find out how locals went about preparing for today. While shopping centres around the country recorded thousands of shoppers scrambling for marked down goods, in Durban it was not entirely the case. At the Atrium in Overport, Checkers management took a smarter approach by only allowing in a few shoppers at a time to avoid congestion. Speaking to the Daily News after their purchase, Tanya September and Kiel Vertuin, they were already sitting and waiting for Checkers to open from 5am! “We got here bright and early hoping to be in and out in minutes,” he said. Vertuin said they had perused through the Checkers sale pamphlets days before so they knew exactly what to look for. “We crossed off the items we needed and made sure everyone knew what they needed to get. It was a quick in, quick out kind of thing,” he said. 
September said the shoppers were a lot calmer than the ones she encountered last year. “It was an absolute breeze,” she said. For a Morningside woman, she had not planned on doing any shopping today but came for the “adventure” of it all. 
“I decided early this morning to just get dressed and come for the fun of it,” Dhanesh Hassan Ally, said. She said he hoped to pick up a few bargains during her shopping. Another resident, Rauff Dawood, said he was looking for specials. Musgrave Centre and Westwood Mall were relatively quiet. Shoppers flocked to Gateway and Pavilion with some standing in queues from last night. Daily News
