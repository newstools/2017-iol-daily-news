Craig Lambinon, spokesperson for the NSRI, said with the approaching full moon, beach bathers and shoreline anglers were most at risk. “The approaching spring tide occurs on December 3, with the next occurring on December 18,” Lambinon said. He said this being the beginning of the festive season with universities and schools closing for December, bathers and boaters around the coast and at inland rivers, dams and lakes needed to be extra cautious. “This spring tide, which peaks on Sunday, means that from about Thursday, the high and low tides will gradually start to increase in intensity, peaking on December 3 and then gradually declining in intensity until about the 8th,” Lambinon said. The next spring tide, a new moon spring tide, peaks on December 18. Spring tides bring a higher than normal high tide and a lower than normal low tide, causing stronger rip currents for a few days leading up to the full moon or new moon. They peak on the day of the moon phase and last for a few days. A rip current is a strong, narrow current of water which retreats from the shore, cutting through incoming waves like a river running out to sea. Although rip currents are always a danger to bathers, they pose the greatest danger during the spring tide when they are stronger than normal. “Bathers are at risk of being swept out to sea by rip currents while swimming or wading in water along the beachfront,” warned Lambinon.
