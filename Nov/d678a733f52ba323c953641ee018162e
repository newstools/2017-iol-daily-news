Principal Dr Marge Bhagowat said the number of pupils who 
studied physical science had declined. “It’s the pupil’s prerogative to choose physical science or not, but the school has been engaging in programmes to attract and motivate more girls to take physical science. “One of our pupils won bronze in the recent science expo,” Bhagowat said. Farah Khan, the best performer in physical science at the school, said the paper was “manageable” and that she expected good results. “It was much easier than the preparatory exams, though there were a few challenging questions, but I managed to answer them,” 
she said. Luyanda Mthabela said the paper was “challenging, but fair”. “I’m an average pupil, and there were level one and level two questions for average pupils, which I was able to complete,” she said. Head girl Noluthando Ngwenya said that reviewing past papers really made a difference. “I sourced different study material from different papers and that was how I prepared,” she said. Sthembile Ndlovu, who wants to study civil engineering at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, felt the paper was average. “I’m good in maths and physics. Even though there were a few challenging questions, I was able to answer them,” she said. Earlier this year, Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana said the focus this year was to achieve nothing less than a 76% pass rate. Daily News
