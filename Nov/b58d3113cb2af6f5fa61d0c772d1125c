The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal called for a full investigation into security companies operating in the eThekwini metro (Durban). "The DA believes that especially in eThekwini political interference plays a significant role in the issuing of tenders for security companies. That is why we have written to the municipal manager Sipho Nzuza requesting him to institute a full investigation into security companies operating in eThekwini," DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said. In 2015 the DA had called for an investigation into all security companies awarded tenders in eThekwini. "We were told that Deloitte is investigating the matter; yet since we have not received any feedback whatsoever. We are not even sure if the investigation had taken place," he said. The DA believed that it was time for a complete overhaul of the security company system in eThekwini. The contracts of the eThekwini municipality’s security companies expired three years ago, but the African National Congress "refuses to award tenders to new security companies". The DA’s long-standing call for a transparent tender process where all security companies could have a fair chance to apply for these lucrative tenders had been falling on deaf ears. "It is clear that the city wants to ensure that the preferred and politically connected are kept in the system to line their own pockets," Mncwango said. "We requested the MM [municipal manager] to include in the investigation the names of the directors and employees of the city’s security companies as well as an explanation of why the tendering process in eThekwini is taking so long. "We have given the MM seven days to respond to our request. If our request again falls on deaf ears the DA will refer the matter to the office of the public protector. The DA will not allow the people’s money to be wasted on corrupt tenders," Mncwango said. - African News Agency (ANA)
