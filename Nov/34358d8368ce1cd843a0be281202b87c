Durban - A security guard who was shot while responding to a panic alert on the Bluff on Monday has died in hospital. Phumzile Fitshane was shot in the chest and abdomen following a house robbery in Maxwell Avenue. Brian Jackson, Blue Security Operations Director, said Fitshane arrived at the scene and was confronted by two men, armed with rifles. “A gang of eight men arrived at the property. The officer responded to the scene and parked his car at the side of the road. The two suspects, stationed as look-outs outside the house, saw the guard and opened fire. He got back into his car to take cover,” Jackson said. Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care Operations Director, said the guard was stabilised at the scene before being rushed to hospital. He was in a critical condition. A domestic worker at the house was also treated for injuries sustained after she jumped over a neighbour’s wall to escape the armed gang. An airgun, a modem and a cellphone were reported stolen. Brighton Beach police are investigating. Meanwhile, tributes have been streaming through on social media following news of Fitshane’s death. Andreas Mathios, spokesperson for Blue Security, said he was heartbroken by the news. “I was with him yesterday at the hospital and held his hand before surgery. I was going to visit first thing in the morning and the hospital notified me of his passing. May his soul rest in peace. May God Grant our men, protection as we continue to fight against these evil monsters. God bless you Phumzile you made the ultimate sacrifice under dangerous circumstances,” he said. Members of fellow private security companies also extended their condolences to Fitshane’s family.
