Durban - Eight men were arrested in connection with four copper memorial plaques that were stolen on outside the Durban City Hall last week. The copper plates were part of a memorial commemorating the South African Soldiers who died during the World Wars. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, police spokesperson, said the men are aged between 25 and 35-years old. “They were detained at Durban Central police station after they were linked to the theft of the copper plates. A  9mm pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition was also recovered. The arrested suspects will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon on charges of theft and possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition,” she said. The metal has been handed over to the South African Army for safe keeping while the investigation continues.

Nine of the plates that were stolen were erected on walls that surround the Durban City Cenotaph, which is situated on the western side of the city hall. A tenth plate was removed from the front of the plinth. The plates are inscribed with the names of Durban citizens who fell in all wars.
 Four brass cappings from a dome were taken and several other plates were damaged during attempts to remove them with a crowbar. Daily News
