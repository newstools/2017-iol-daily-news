Durban - Heavy snow has fallen in parts of KwaZulu-Natal as cold and wet conditions continue to sweep through the province. Snow has been recorded in Sani Pass, Swartberg and Underberg. There have also been reports of snowfall in Mooi River. The Eastern Cape has also had a significant amount of snowfall over the last 24 hours.
