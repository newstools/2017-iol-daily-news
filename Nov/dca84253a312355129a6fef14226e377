Army tanks were seen driving into the country’s capital, Harare. There were allegations that President Robert Mugabe was placed under house arrest. Speaking to the Daily News, Kudzai Taruona said he would return to his country of birth immediately if Mugabe was in fact ousted as president. “I came to South Africa at the height of hyperinflation when my university salary was not enough to even get me a pair of shoes,” said Taruona, who has just completed his PhD in Theology.

It is the shake-up that Zimbabwe needed,” he said. Taruona said he had been chatting to his relatives, some of whom live in the capital city, and they have said “it is business as usual”.

Another Zimbabwean national, who asked not to be named, said his family had not reported anything untoward to him. “I am not too familiar with the inside politics, but my family have said they are carrying on with life. It would be interesting to see the outcome of all of this,” he said. Albert Hororo said he received unconfirmed reports that Mugabe was under house arrest and not at his presidential home. Hororo was unsure if he would return home. Daily News
