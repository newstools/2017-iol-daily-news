It is believed that the minibus taxi suffered a tyre blowout shortly after 6am. Kyle van Reenen, spokesperson for Crisis Medical, said when emergency teams arrived at the scene, they found the injured passengers clambering to safety as the twisted frame of a Toyota HiAce lay on its roof. “The wreckage was occupying the left hand lane of the Durban bound carriageway, near the Swapo Road bridge. The injured were assessed and treated at the scene, before being taken by ambulances to various nearby medical facilities for further care,” van Reenen said.
