Durban - A Norwegian student was not letting anything stop her from boarding her flight to Europe on Tuesday morning, including an accident just kilometers away from the King Shaka International Airport. The 23-year old woman sustained minor injuries when the car she was in collided into a truck and a traffic light at the intersection of Canelands and the R102. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA, said the woman simply brushed off her injuries and was determined to get to the airport on time. “When our team arrived at the scene, they found that a white VW Polo had crashed into the truck and traffic light on the northbound lane of the R102. The car was an Uber taxi and the driver and two occupants of the truck were treated at the scene before being taken to hospital for further care,” Balram said. The Norwegian woman was in the country to complete her Psychology Studies and lives in Oslo. Balram said the woman explained that she was on her way to the airport to board a flight to Europe. She claimed that the driver had been driving erratically, and had taken her off her route causing her an hour delay. “The hysterical woman refused medical treatment and requested that RUSA officers get her to the airport as boarding gates were about to close. The officers complied and the woman was dropped off at the airport. Daily News
