Durban - Three people were left injured after the roof of a mosque collapsed on worshipers on Wick Street in Verulam, a town north of Durban, leaving three people injured on Monday afternoon. Prem Balram, Reaction Units South Africa spokesperson said, “At approximately 13:34 members of Reaction Unit South Africa were called out to the scene after receiving multiple calls from the public and businesses reporting an explosion at the mosque. Upon arrival it was established that as worshipers were exiting the mosque after their daily prayer the entire roof collapsed trapping several of them under the rubble.”  Balram said it could not be established how many people were in the mosque at the time the roof collapsed.  “The SAPS K9 Search and Rescue Unit with the use of a specialised dog is currently conducting a search of the debris to confirm that there are no further entrapments,” said Balram.  The cause of the structural collapse is yet to be established.  This is a developing story and will be updated. Daily News
