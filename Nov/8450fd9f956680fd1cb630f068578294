An average of 1.3 million shoppers visit the centre each month. Although its strategic location at the gateway to uMlazi does attract a cosmopolitan mix of consumers from a large catchment area, most are from the local communities of uMlazi and Lamontville. Gugu Dlamini, managing director of Sizovuna Investments, a broad-based black economic empowerment private investment company comprising six shareholders based in uMlazi and Lamontville which bought a 25% stake in Umlazi Mega city in 2010, pointed out that the revamp and expansion had taken retailing within the region to the next level. “The original Umlazi Mega City provided a much needed critical mass of quality retail outlets for the residents of uMlazi. The revitalised centre will provide a more rounded retail experience that has become the trend and the objective of malls that are on the cutting edge of retail in South Africa,” she said. “This could see the retention of a larger portion of shoppers’ spend within the local area and ultimately the empowerment of local people through the creation of jobs and career and business opportunities. We have also witnessed uMlazi and Lamontville contractors benefiting and then providing employment to locals during the redevelopment,” she said. The revamp will see the creation of upgraded ablution facilities and the addition of a new and larger taxi rank that offers ablutions for taxi commuters, with 370 parking bays added. Traffic flow within the mall will be significantly improved. Umlazi Mega City has 160 stores covering the fashion, food, supermarket, cellphone, health and beauty, home and lifestyle, hardware, sport, footwear and medical categories. Anchors include the likes of Mega Super Spar, Pick n Pay and Woolworths. All major banks are represented. Daily News
