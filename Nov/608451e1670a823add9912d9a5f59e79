“It is the first time that a Chinese film has been shot in Durban,” said Jianzhou Wang, the locally-based Chinese consul-general. Several Durban shots included underwater scenes, he said. “They hired a lot of people from the local film industry too,” added Wang, who invited the Chinese community and ­local dignitaries to the movie at Gateway Theatre of Shopping. The film - Wolf Warrior 2 - a sequel, is a fast-moving action-packed drama, which tells the story of a loose cannon Chinese soldier who takes on special missions around the world. This time, he finds himself in an African country protecting medical aid workers from the local rebels and vicious arms dealers. It features the producer and star, martial arts expert Wu Jing. As well as filming in Durban for several days, the crew also shot footage in Soweto and Alexandra. Although Wolf Warrior 2 was only released in China in July, it has already outperformed such blockbusters as Titanic and Jurassic Park. The latest box office figures realised the equivalent of US$870.3m (Titanic stood at US$659m and Jurassic Park at US$652m). It is the only non-Hollywood film to have been included in the list of 100 all-time highest grossing films worldwide and has been selected as the Chinese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards next year.
