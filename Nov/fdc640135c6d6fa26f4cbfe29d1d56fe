Leonard Munsami and Feroz Khan were granted R30 000 and R40 000 bail respectively following their arrest on Friday, last week. Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, Hawks spokesperson, said the pair were arrested for drug dealing in Unit 2, Phoenix. “Officers received a tip off about drug dealing activities in the area and a search warrant was obtained. When the team arrived at the address given, they searched the house and found a kilogram of cocaine powder, 50 pieces of crack cocaine,1 000 mandrax tablets and 550 ecstasy tablets. The drugs had an estimated street value of approximately R500 000,” Mhlongo said.  Munsami, 31, and Khan, 44, were granted R30 000 and R40 000 bail respectively. The case was adjourned to January 31, 2018. 
The bust in Phoenix comes just days after two people were arrested in Camperdown, near Pietermaritzburg for cultivating and dealing in dagga.  “On November 2, officers seized dagga plants, a large quantity of dagga oil, magic mushrooms and equipment used to process dagga. The street value of the seized items is approximately R 450 000,” Mhlongo said. The two, Simone Turkington, 38 and Zander Steyn, 27, were remanded in custody following their court appearance.
