Durban - The Department of Home Affairs has warned against a hoax message doing the rounds on social media. The message claims that the lifespan of the green barcoded Identity Document comes to an end on March 31, 2018. In a statement issued by the department, they said never issued such an announcement. “We wish to make it clear that the green barcoded ID book remains a legal form of identification and will continue to be until such time that the Live Capture System is rolled out to all Home Affairs offices to enable South Africans to apply for Smart ID cards at their nearest offices. The Department has developed a plan to systematically phase out the green ID book and ultimately consolidate the restoration, common citizenship, identity and dignity to South Africa,” the statement read. Mava Scott, Ministerial spokesperson, said, the department encourages residents to apply for Smart Cards. “In addition, the department has established a partnership with FNB, Standard Bank, Nedbank and ABSA to create an online portal where clients can lodge their application without visiting a Home Affairs office,” Scott said.
