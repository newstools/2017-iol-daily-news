Residents living near the depot in Clayfield Road heard the sound of the tractor on the road and were curious to know why it was leaving the depot so late on Saturday evening. Bradley Singh, a ward councillor for Clayfield, said residents alerted him and the police. “It is alleged that the security guard who was working at the depot during the day stole the tractor with another 
employee of the parks department. They were seated on the tractor. “Residents stopped them before they could join Phoenix Highway,” Singh said. If the tractor was stolen, Singh said, it would have been a disaster for residents. “Service delivery would have been compromised. The December period is when many grass cuts and verge trimmings are done. “Previously, a truck had a problem at the depot and it took the municipality three years to repair it. How many years would it take for it to replace a new tractor?” Singh asked. The eThekwini parks management arrived at the scene and moved the tractor to the depot. Phoenix police are investigating. The employee is expected to appear in court today. Daily News
