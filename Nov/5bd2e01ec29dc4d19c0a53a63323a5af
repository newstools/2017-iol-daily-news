Govender, 47, grew up in a thunee-fanatical home and was quick to learn from his brother, and late father, Krish, by the time he turned 11. When Govender completed matric in 1988 at Merebank Secondary School he was still deciding what career path he would take. Govender, a father of two children, moved to Gauteng, where he studied and worked for 22 years before returning to Durban in 2012. Thunee, after the Tamil word for water, is a popular risk-taking card game that originated in Durban. It was invented by Indian indentured-labourers who arrived in South Africa to work in the sugar cane fields. “When I was in Gauteng I wanted to play thunee but there were not many players. I basically developed the game for myself so I could play. I created the desktop version app in the mid-1990s but never released it. I developed the Android version in 2009 and then released it in 2015. I dedicated the app to my father who taught me everything about thunee,” Govender said. This is the first thunee app in the world. Govender programmed the game to be as realistic as possible. He is enhancing the game to include a multi-player version where friends can play against one another from anywhere in the world. “The older generation of thunee players were very skilled, thoughtful and strategic. They played the game like it was chess. I am grateful to have 50 000 downloads worldwide, with the second-highest players in India,” Govender said. He has written two other card games, called  304 and 28, which are popular in Sri Lanka and north India. “My intention is to create a thunee league in KwaZulu-Natal and then grow it nationally. Each suburb should have their teams and compete against one another,” he said. Govender is also involved in building robots and other interesting devices from Lego blocks. The app can be downoaded from Google Play. Find out more at www.thunee.net.za. Daily News
