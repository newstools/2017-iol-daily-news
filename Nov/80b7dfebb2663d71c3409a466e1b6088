Khoza’s return to the political scene is on the horizon with a founding congress of a new political party set for early next month. The new party’s official launch is scheduled for next year, Khoza revealed on Tuesday. Their aim is to challenge the big three parties in the 2019 national elections. Khoza said the party had “a lot of comrades who are coming from the ANC” while others would join the party from the DA and EFF, with the United Front of Civics and the Forum 4 Service Delivery already on board. She also said some members of the National Freedom Party (NFP) would be joining her new venture. Khoza said the new party was not an ANC breakaway party, but a merger between several political parties. She said these formations were merging because they had seen South Africa fragmenting and being divided, while their aim was for unity. She said it was time for the ANC to hand over the reins to people who have “a high moral stamina and who are ethical”, and who can take South Africa to the next level. Daily News
