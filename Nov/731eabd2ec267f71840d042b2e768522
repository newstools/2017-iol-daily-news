Durban - Three members of a housebreaking syndicate have been arrested following a high speed chase on the N2 on Thursday morning. It is alleged that the men had robbed a house in Amanzimtoti, where they held up a domestic worker and ransacked the house. The same gang then allegedly attempted to rob a second house when they were spotted. Tony Lokker, Managing Member of ET Rapid Response said they received a panic alert via the community policing network and gave chase. "We chased them from Amanzimtoti until the intersection of Dumisani Makhaye Drive where the men crashed their silver VW Polo. Five men alighted from the car and ran away. We managed to apprehend three," he said. It is suspected that this gang is one of at least two gangs believed to be targeting Durban North homes. Earlier this week, the Daily News reported that there had been a spike in house robberies in the area. In all the cases,Â  gangs reportedly derailed property gates before entering the homes. Police confirmed that a case has been opened. The men face a number of charges, including posession of property suspected to be stolen. The Polo had false number plates. Police are yet to establish the car's correct owner. The area has been cordoned off while police gather further evidence Daily News
