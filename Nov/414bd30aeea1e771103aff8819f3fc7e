Durban - A woman accused of the murder of her boyfriend's ten year old son and the son's friend smiled as the case against her was adjourned - much to the ire of angry community members who packed the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday. Amahle Bongiwe Maliwa appeared in court with her friend Liziwe Ngwayitshe and a Malawian traditional healer, Ali Yusuf. They are all charged with two counts of murder, two counts of kidnapping and assault with intend to cause grievous bodily harm. They were arrested last week for the murder of Njabulo Mankayi, 10, whose father had a romantic relationship with Maliwa and his friend Luyanda Msomi, 10, who were abducted on the way from school two weeks ago. Luyanda's body was found near railway station in Clairwood. Njabulo's body was found last Monday dumped in Bayhead. The community of Khayelitsha Informal Settlement were angry at Maliwa's behaviour in court when she appeared to smile as she walked down to the holding cells. They said she treated the court proceedings as 'a joke' and had no respect for the court and the law. They shouted 'go away' as she left the courtroom with her co- accused The case was postponed to January 26 for further investigation. The three accused indicated through their lawyer that they would abandon their bail application next time they appear in court. Speaking outside court the parents of the deceased children said they wanted her to be taught a lesson. Thandaza Mankayi said his ex-girlfriend's behavior disappointed him as he had expected her to show remorse for what she did. "She is not remorseful. She kept smiling as if nothing happened. Even after the case was postponed to next January she was not bothered that she would spend Christmas in jail, she looked happy," said
