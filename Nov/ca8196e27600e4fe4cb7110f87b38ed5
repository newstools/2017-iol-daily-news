Bafana face Senegal on Friday in a must-win game to keep alive their Russia 2018 hopes, while the final decision on the 2023 Rugby World Cup host will be made next Wednesday. World Rugby announced a week ago that South Africa had produced a “superb bid” and was the “clear leader” on a competitive tendering process to host the tournament, but they face bitter competition from Ireland and France in the final days before the announcement. “We are within touching distance of realising a long-held dream to host the Rugby World Cup once again,” said Thulas Nxesi, Minister of Sport and Recreation. “We need to send a clear message to the World Rugby Council that South Africa is ready and excited to host the tournament. “That is why we are calling on all South Africans to unite behind this wonderful, nation-building event. “I would urge all South Africans to wear their Springbok jerseys or something green and gold on Friday as well as on D-Day - Wednesday - to show their eagerness and excitement to welcome the Rugby World Cup back to South Africa,” Nxesi said. Corporate South Africa has been urged to back the initiative by allowing staff to wear green tomorrow and Wednesday. “We want to turn the factories, schools, shops, offices and malls green to underline the message to the Rugby World Cup board that South Africa is the best choice to host the 2023 tournament,” said SA Rugby president Mark Alexander. The SA Football Association has urged the country to “show your love” for Bafana and to fill the stadium in Polokwane. Daily News
