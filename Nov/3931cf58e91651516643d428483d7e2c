Durban - On any other day of the year, Durbanâ€™s city centre is usually quiet before 7am, however, on Black Friday, it was packed. From the corner of Dr Pixley Kaseme Street and Dr Yusuf Dadoo Street (West Street and Broad Street) down to the corner of Dr Pixley Kaseme Street and Joe Slovo Street (West Street and Field Street) customers had already started queuing up for Black Friday deals.
