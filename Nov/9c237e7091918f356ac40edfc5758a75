Durban - Fodor’s Travel has chosen Durban as one of the top 52 destinations to visit in 2018. Fodor’s is one of the most inventive guidebook publishers and travel resources in the U.S. market. Mayasree Moodley, Durban Tourism public relations officer said Durban made it onto the list after editor Teddy Minford attended a recent media FAM trip to the city. “In addition to providing a candid overview of the city and its unique attractions, Teddy also features Hilton Durban, The Oyster Box and Station Drive Precinct as highlights,” said Moodley. Phillip Sithole, Head of Durban Tourism said that Durban is poised and ready for a period of dramatic and exciting growth from the USA Market. Durban to be recognised as a Top 52 destination to visit in 2018 will undoubtedly spark new interest to travellers and hopefully significantly grow the North American travel sector for the city. “The accolade is a re-enforcement that the US Traveller is now looking for new, unique experiences. The city has received a substantial amount of publicity from the USA market, since the appointment of the U.S.-based PHG Consulting to aggressively market the City of Durban to the North American market as part of a three year contract. The U.S. is currently the Number 3 source market for Durban, KZN,” said Moodley. She said results of various surveys revealed that mainstream North American travellers view SA as a desirable tourism destination but possess limited of the travel experiences Durban has to offer. This lack of knowledge and clarity, PHG Consulting has been focusing on informing and introducing Durban’s vast experiential and cultural opportunities to the North American market. Daily News
