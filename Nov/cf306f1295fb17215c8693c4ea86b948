The Durban High Court is to evaluate their evidence before deciding whether they should be considered for parole. Sthembiso Shelembe was convicted for murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances in 2001. After serving close to 17 years, he is one of the 85 lifers, some over  70, who took the Department of Correctional Services to court on Wednesday, claiming that they should have been considered for parole. They claimed prison authorities at New Prison in Pietermaritzburg had turned down their applications on several occasions regardless of their having completed the relevant procedures to qualify for parole. According to the affidavit presented on Wednesday by Nkosinathi Ntenza on behalf of the 84 prisoners, the minister of Correctional Services does not consider lifers for parole at the stipulated time.  “We are entitled to be considered for parole upon completing 13 years and four months of our respective sentences. Many of us have already served the stipulated time but have yet to be considered for parole,” said Ntenza. Dressed in freshly ironed shirts, formal pants, ties and shiny black shoes, four of the applicants - who appeared on behalf of the 85 applicants - told The Daily News it was their first outing in years. Closely guarded and confined in leg irons, they were hopeful that the court would listen to their plea. They spoke to their legal representative, advocate Indhera Goberdhan, and to friends and relatives there to support them.  After months of raising funds from prison, and a number of  internal applications since 2011, there were now 85 applications. Judge Graham Lopes adjourned the matter until December 13. He said the matter could not proceed on Wednesday without the presence of the respondent. Daily News
