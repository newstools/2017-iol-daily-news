Durban - Three men were arrested and a cache of drugs found during a raid at two Phoenix homes on Monday. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesman, said officers proceeded to the first target which was a house suspected to be openly selling narcotics. "As the members approached the house throngs of smokers fled from the house. Upon entering the premises two men started running from the police officers but the members quickly caught up with them.  The first suspect was searched and a black plastic bag was found in his possession," he said. The plastic bag was opened and mandrax tablets, heroine in capsules as well as cash were found. The 29-year-old suspect was immediately placed under arrest. "The second suspect was searched and he was also found in possession of a similar black plastic bag which contained heroin, rock cocaine as well as mandrax tablets," Zwane said. Further investigations revealed that both the suspects are in the country illegally. Officers then went to the second targeted home and began to search the premises. "The members requested that the dogs be removed from the kennels and began searching inside. The members found dagga stashed inside the kennels. The search continued, a further stash of dagga was found and a 25-year-old suspect was arrested," Zwane said. Major General Bheki Langa, KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, commended the members for confiscating the drugs and arresting the suspects. “These operations show that the police in the province are committed in cleaning up the streets from drug smugglers,” he said Daily News
