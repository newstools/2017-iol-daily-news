Following a mammoth trial, Judge Dayalin Chetty handed down his verdict in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday. Panayiotou was found guilty on a charge of murder. The remaining counts of conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, and defeating the ends of justice fell away. He was visibly flushed and red in the face as judgment was handed down. Sinethemba Nenembe was found guilty on charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Zolani Sibeko was found guilty on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder, but was acquitted on the remaining counts. Jayde’s family, including father Derrick, Michelle and Toni Inggs, as well as a sea of “Justice For Jayde” supporters, were overcome with emotion and embraced one another following the guilty verdicts. They clapped their hands in celebration. Panayiotou’s family members were seen crying, and they dropped their heads as the businessman was sent down to the cells. Sentencing will take place on November 17. - ANA
