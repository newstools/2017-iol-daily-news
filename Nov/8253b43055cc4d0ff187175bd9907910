Durban - Twelve corrupt police officers, working at border posts in the northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal have been dismissed. The dismissala comes after an internal investigation into corrupt activities at the Kosi Bay and Golela Border Posts. 
 
Major General Bheki Langa,  KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, commended the role played by the community from the Umkhanyakude area for raising the alarm and reporting these corrupt police officers. 
 
“We want to reassure the public that we remain committed to dealing with corrupt police officers decisively,” he said Langa said President Jacob Zuma, visited the Umkhanyakude area to listen to the concerns of the community with regards to crime. "The Emanguzi police station as well as the Kosi Bay Border Post were visited. The President and his delegation made observations after listening to the community and instructed police management for increased and focused crime fighting efforts in the area as well as at the greater northern border posts. A  project coordinated by the Office of the Acting National Commissioner and Acting Provincial Commissioner of KwaZulu-Natal, was established to deal with the challenges identified," he said. The project yielded positive results as a number of arrests were made and stolen vehicles were also recovered. It also emerged during these operations that some police officers at border post were corrupt, which resulted in a undercover operation being instituted. These 12 officers were nabbed for corruption and were charged criminally and internally. Daily News
