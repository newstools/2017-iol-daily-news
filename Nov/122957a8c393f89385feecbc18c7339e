Durban - Municipal officials are working around the clock to ensure that the foul odour emanating from the Phoenix Waste Water Treatment Works (PWWTW) is addressed speedily and efficiently. This is according to Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson. For more than two months, residents have been complaining about a sewage smell in the area. Many have taken to social media to post their complaints and concerns. Resident, Cynthia Naidoo, said due to the smell, they have to keep their doors and windows closed. Another resident, Sandra Pillay, said the smell left her nauseas. "It makes you feel like you want to throw up," she wrote. Others complained that they had to keep their children inside. 
Mthethwa said the foul odour is a result of the upgrade of the Phoenix plant which has caused excessive untreated sludge. “To address the issue, various departments within the municipality have conducted an odour assessment and action items were developed and are being implemented. These include the urgent removal of the excessive sludge while finalisation of the PWWTW contract is in process. Odour control systems have been installed near the site and a mobile unit is also available,” she said. Residents are advised that during the removal of sludge and while the plant upgrade proceeds, they may be subjected to malodours from time to time. 
“The municipality apologises to all affected members of the community and assures them that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that 
the problem is speedily resolved,” Mthethwa said. Daily News
