Sixty-eight-year-old Jonathan David was admitted at the Pietermaritzburg High Court last Friday, 39 years after an educational psychologist advised him that “being a lawyer was the right fit” for him. “It shows you are never too late to reach your dream. Age is just a number, after all,” David said this week. David, who was in the same class at Sastri College, in Durban, as former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, had sought the advice of a psychologist when he was 29 because he was not quite sure what direction his professional life should take. But he was hampered in following the advice by not having gone to a primary school that taught Afrikaans and so settled down to working in the financial services industry. “I thought it would be temporary, but it lasted 38years,” he said. Then at 61, after a spell of working in Dubai and Canada and while still working at his day job, he decided to study for his Bachelor of Law (LLB) degree through Unisa. “It required a lot of application as I had not studied for a long time. But I have always read a lot and have 3000 books in my personal library,” he said. Five years later he graduated and did practical legal training in the same year, which enabled him to reduce his period of articles to a year, completing them with ABMaharajh attorneys on the Bluff. He had obtained a BCom degree from Unisa in 1975, but was refused articles to do chartered accountancy by various firms “because of racial discrimination”. David recalled that when he arrived for interviews, companies realised he was not white as his name indicated, and thus the doors were no longer open to him. He also holds an insurance industry qualification. Having worked in a variety of positions, from accounting, insurance to sales and management, he felt that he brought a rich experience to the legal profession. And his next goal? “To pursue a Master's and ultimately a doctorate in law,” he said. Daily News
