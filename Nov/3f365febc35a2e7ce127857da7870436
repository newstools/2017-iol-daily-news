The 25-year-old from Wentworth was one of 26 other aspiring footballers around the country who participated in the competition held at the High Performance Centre (HPC) in Pretoria. The competition featured a week-long training session with Chelsea FC senior international foundation coaches who recognised Roskruge as the best player to take up the opportunity of a lifetime to train with the international football club. “It’s a dream come true. Although it hasn’t sunk in yet, I’m happy and excited about going to London. The fact that I was selected from a large group of other talented soccer players who entered the competition overwhelms me and gives me the confidence I need,” said Roskruge. He described his style of play as similar to that of Chelsea’s Eden Hazard. “I am very happy and excited about going to London. Meeting players like Eden Hazard and Willian, training with a team like Chelsea would uplift my career as a soccer player and put me on the map,” said Roskruge. Gareth Marshall, senior brand manager of Shield South Africa, said they were proud to have been able to offer such opportunities. “When we started this programme, we recognised that there was a big developmental gap at grass-roots level. We are bridging that gap through exposing our local players to international professional soccer stars.” Roskruge and two other winners from Cape Town are expected to leave for London on November 29.
