The Rhino 8 team comprises various government departments, including members from various units of SAPS, Customs and Excise, the SANDF and Ezemvelo and SANParks Game Rangers. Police Brigadier Vish Naidoo said two of the 50 suspected poachers were aged 24 and 33 years. “They were arrested as recently as this past weekend after they were found in possession of a .375 hunting rifle in KwaMsane. Police also seized a Toyota Hilux bakkie in which they were travelling. This team has been doing sterling work since its inception, arresting dozens of suspected rhino poachers and recovering arms, ammunition and vehicles among other incriminating items,” Naidoo said.
