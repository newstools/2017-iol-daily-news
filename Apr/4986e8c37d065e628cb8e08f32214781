UPDATE: DURBAN – The disciplinary hearings into the controversial upgrades of President Jacob Zuma’s R246-million Nkandla was adjourned until July. This after, Sibusiso Chonco, one of 10  Public Works officials who have been fingered in the irregular expenditure convinced the hearing that he was too ill to participate in it. The hearings, chaired by Adv Thulani Khuzwayo was postponed to July 4 for three days. It was the second postponement. Chonco's legal representative, Adrian Moodley had on Monday presented Khuzwayo with a sick note showing that Chonco had been booked off sick from work by a doctor from March 29 to April 29. Moodley was told yesterday to tell his client to avail himself for Mondays hearing. Moodley argued  for a postponement on Monday saying his client could not testify due to the side effects of the medication he is taking. "My instruction is to seek a postponement in respect of my client's medical condition. If you would like to interrogate the medical condition, we will agree to that," Moodley said. Khuzwayo, insisted that the matter of Chonco's illness was dealt with yesterday before an instruction was issued for the latter to present himself today. Moodley responded in the affirmative. "Yes Mr chairperson, but it is my instruction to seek a postponement of this matter. I present a medical certificate from my client's general practitioner, the medical prescription and also taking into consideration his blood pressure and the side effects of his medication are to be taken into consideration," Moodley said. The department is argued against the postponement. Khuzwwayo conceded to Chonco's request and postponed the matter to July.
