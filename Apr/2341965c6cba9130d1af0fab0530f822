Johannesburg â€“ Barbara Hogan, former minister and Ahmed Kathrada's widow, launched a scathing attack on President Jacob Zuma, saying he should step down. Hogan criticised Zuma, who axed five ministers and two deputies in the dead of the night o Thursday, saying: "Mr President ... you have sacrificed everything we stood for on the altar of greed and corruption." She was speaking Kathrada's memorial held at the Joburg City Hall on Saturday. It was organised by the Ahmed Kathrada and Nelson Mandela Foundations and SACP Gauteng. This after government announced it had postponed Kathrada's official memory service, which was scheduled for today, indefinitely. Kathrada died earlier this week following a recent surgery to remove clotting on his brain. He was buried at West Park Cemetery in a highly charged service, where speakers criticised Zuma's leadership of the county and the ANC, and repeated calls for him to step down.  At the memorial service, Hogan said they would not be silenced, saying if Zuma has eyes to see and ears to listen, he would don't he honourable thing and step down. She received a standing ovation as she delivered her last words before taking her seat: "This country is not for sale." @luyolomkentane  luyolo.mkentane@inl.co.za  Political Bureau
