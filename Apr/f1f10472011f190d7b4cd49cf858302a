It has emerged that she was shot in the head while she was with her boyfriend at her home. A man, 34, who is a bodyguard for the mayor of uMshwathi Municipality, apparently tried to take Phoswa to a hospital, but she died before they could get there. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, provincial police spokesperson, said a man had handed himself over, and a case of murder was opened. “The gun that was used is believed to belong to a guard from another municipality. Investigations are continuing,” he said. The Daily News’ sister paper, Isolezwe, reported that Phoswa and her boyfriend were apparently arguing when the shooting happened on Monday. However, details of the argument are unclear. “We are confused as we don’t know about her boyfriend, and we don’t know what they were arguing over,” said Phoswa’s uncle, Zachariah Phoswa. The incident brought back painful memories for Zachariah, because Phoswa’s parents and two brothers were killed on the same day in 1987 at the house, during the violence that plagued the area at that time. Phoswa’s bodyguard, Max Dlamini, found her lying on her bed with a gunshot wound to her head. Dlamini said the suspect was still in shock and could not explain what had happened. Police were still at the scene, combing her home for clues. Phoswa leaves behind a 16-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter. Sibonelo Bhengu, Richmond Municipality spokesperson, said staff were in shock. This was the second person in the municipality to die recently. Phoswa’s death comes barely a month after the murder of municipal manager Edward Sibusiso Sithole. He was shot dead. A manhunt is still continuing for his killers. Nomusa Dube, Co-operative Governance MEC, and Mxolisi Kaunda, Community Safety and Liaison MEC, both called for calm and urged people to work with the police. Daily News
