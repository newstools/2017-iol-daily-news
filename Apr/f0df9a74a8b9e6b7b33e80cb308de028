This incident follows the poisoning of at least 14 monkeys in Hibberdene a couple of weeks ago and the suspected poisoning of at least four monkeys in Hilton last week. Steve Smit, of the KZN Monkey Helpline volunteer group, said he could not sleep on Monday night as he was stressed about the other monkeys who might have eaten the poisoned food in Queensburgh and had died elsewhere. The helpline was contacted by Margi Moody, 41, in Ponsford Crescent, who found a dead hadeda in her garden. When her son went to bury it in the backyard, he stumbled across the dead monkeys. “She found two dead monkeys in the garden, another dead monkey under a shrub up against the boundary wall right next to her house. Others were spread out elsewhere. She found a monkey, still breathing, next to her house with a baby sitting on top of her. We suspect they were poisoned,” Smit said. Smit’s attempts to catch the baby monkey on Monday proved fruitless but he will search again this morning. The mother died en route to the vet. “From the location of the bodies it is obvious that the poison used was “two-step”, a lethal poison easily available. The poisoned food must have been put out literally by a close neighbour of the property where the monkeys died,” Smit said. “Killing monkeys is an unacceptable and illegal way of dealing with the presence of monkeys and poisoning is certainly both immoral and illegal,” Smit said.
