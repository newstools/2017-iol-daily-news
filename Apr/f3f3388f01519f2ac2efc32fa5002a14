His screams for help will forever be etched in his granny Roshini Moodley’s memory. She was looking after her four grandchildren, including 2-year-old Ritesh Ramlall, at their Clare Road home. The fire allegedly started in one of the bedrooms. Moodley said they were alerted to the fire when smoke and flames engulfed the house. She tried in vain, using buckets of water and a garden hose, to douse the flames, but the roof was collapsing and the smoke choked them. Neighbours also tried to get to the boy, but were overwhelmed by the smoke. Her daughter, Molly Moodley, 32, who lives in the basement, ran into the house and pulled out 1-year-old Mahesh, the youngest grandchild, who had been crawling in the kitchen before the fire spread. The other children managed to escape unharmed. The house was completely gutted by the time firefighters arrived. Shireen Ramlall, Ritesh’s mother, said they were at the Durban Magistrate’s Court when they received the news their house was on fire. “On the way back I was thinking of my children. When I got back, neighbours broke the news to me. I feel like my heart has been ripped out. He was close to me. When I leave home, he always asks me if I love him,” Ramlall said. Neighbours and community representatives are assisting the family with funeral arrangements. Alfred Newman, eThekwini fire department’s divisional commander, said the cause of the fire would be investigated. Sydenham police have opened an inquest docket. Harilall Budhram, of the Clare Estate Shiv Temple, urged the public to donate clothes and other commodities to help the family get back on their feet. Budhram said the family would live with neighbours in the interim. Daily News
