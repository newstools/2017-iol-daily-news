SANDF spokesperson Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi said: “We are tired of people wearing military camouflage. “We have seen that people are overdoing it and it has become a fashion accessory.” The ire of the armed forces was  sparked during Armed Forces Day in Durban in February. “We had a meeting about this last year, but it was during Armed Forces Day that we saw there were too many people in military camouflage but were not part of the SANDF. They were there and we decided to take action because the public was also complaining about these people during the event,” he said. This was not the only reason for the army taking a hard stance against camo fashion. Mgobozi said they had been receiving reports that criminals also committed crimes while wearing army uniform. “This is bad for our reputation. If a person gets caught, they will face up to five years in jail or a fine,” Mgobozi said. It is not only the general public who will be affected. “We are also looking at how to best approach organisations like the MK military veterans. This is a sensitive situation and we are still discussing it,” Mgobozi said. There were exceptions, though. He said the army did allow people who had been give special honorary positions to wear military attire. “One of these people is 
Dr Irvin Khoza who is an honorary colonel. But he knows that he can only wear it on certain occasions. We are asking the public, if you have any camouflage please take it to your nearest base,” he said. The army did not have an issue with people who wore T-shirts and other fashion accessories that did not directly resemble the army’s camouflage, he said. This comes as neighbours Zimbabwe clamped down on people wearing military camouflage. Earlier this year, Zimbabwe’s The Herald reported seven people were arrested while having a drink at a club in the city of Kadoma, 131km south west of the capital Harare. The army had already warned people not to wear military camouflage.
