The runner complained she was not feeling well and sat down on the pavement of Masabalala Yengwa (NMR) Avenue before collapsing. Chris Botha, Netcare 911 spokesperson, said an off-duty nursing sister was at the scene and immediately started CPR. “A Netcare 911 advanced life support paramedic and his team as well as another service arrived at the scene. After connecting a heart monitor, they found the runner’s heart had stopped,” said Botha. He said paramedics placed the runner on a ventilator and the team continued with Advanced Life Support resuscitation for about 
20 minutes. “She had to be defibrillated twice before her heart started beating again,” he said, adding the woman was in a stable condition in hospital. Sello Mokoena, president of KwaZulu-Natal Athletics, said he was unaware of the incident. “I am still awaiting reports from race referees,” he said. Daily News
