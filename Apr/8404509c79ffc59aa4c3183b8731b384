Captain Bheki Simelane had been waiting near his home for his transport to work when a VW Golf drove past him. The occupants allegedly fired several shots towards him. Two bullets struck Simelane. He had been stationed at the Point police station, where he was responsible for public relations. His colleagues said they had received the shocking news soon after he was shot. They described Simelane as a humble gentleman. Leonora Bloxham, a retired chief clerk, said she had worked alongside him since 1982 and described him as a first-class policeman. “He was the nicest man. He was like my family. I worked with him at Durban Central SAPS and Point police station,” she said. Daily News
