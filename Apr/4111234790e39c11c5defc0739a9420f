The foundation said on Monday that Palestinians from across political lines had begun an indefinite hunger strike in Israeli jails to mark Palestinian Prisoners’ Day. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation said the hunger strike had been spearheaded by jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouthi. Barghouthi marked his 15th consecutive year in jail on April 15 after being sentenced to five life terms for murder and attempted murder by Israel. Foundation executive director Neeshan Balton said: “The Palestinian prisoners are calling for an end to solitary confinement and administrative detention; fortnightly family visits without cancellation or interference; appropriate medical care, including an end to medical neglect of prisoners; releasing prisoners with disabilities or terminal illness; requests around access to education; and humane transportation of prisoners.” According to the foundation, about 6500 Palestinians are currently behind bars. Balton said the mass support for the hunger strike among prisoners was a show of unity. Daily News
