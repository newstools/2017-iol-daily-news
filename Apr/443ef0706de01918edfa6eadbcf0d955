The magnitude 6.5 quake’s epicentre was nearly 250km north-northwest of the capital Gaborone at a depth of 12km, the US Geological Survey said. Tremors were also felt in South Africa, including Durban and Johannesburg. Many took to social media to comment. On Facebook, many residents living in blocks of flats on the beachfront said they felt the tremor. Buildings also had to be evacuated. Faye Freedman posted: “I felt it strongly on the 15th floor at Rocca Marina on North Beach. The entire building rocked from side to side - it was rather alarming.” Evacuated Issy Tronix said: “It lasted about 30 seconds here in Morningside.” A Reservoir Hills resident said he felt the building sway for 15 seconds. North Beach resident Ishara Harishun said everyone evacuated their flats. There was also a great deal of sarcasm after the tremor, with many blaming it on the cabinet reshuffle or the rand falling. “We certainly felt (the quake) here in central Gaborone. The buildings ... were trembling,” said Botswana’s chief government spokesman, Jeff Ramsay.  “We don’t have any reports of casualties or damage yet but it’s a bit early to tell.” Kgosi Kgomokgwana, the traditional chief of Moiyabana, a village close to the epicentre, said: “This is the first time we have felt something like that in this area.” Reuters, additional reporting Zainul Dawood
