DURBAN - Bafana Bafana coaching target and current SuperSport United mentor Stuart Baxter was hospitalised on Monday, the club have announced. The 63-year-old Baxter has been admitted for emergency medical treatment after battling with his health in recent days. SuperSport United’s medical department told Baxter to seek “specialist medical advice”, the club said in a statement. Baxter is in continuing talks with the South African Football Association about taking over from the fired Shakes Mashaba for a second stint as Bafana Bafana coach. But now he will first have to recover after experiencing “significant discomfort” during Saturday’s Nedbank Cup quarter-final penalty shoot-out victory over Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium. Baxter remained on the bench throughout the Chiefs match and participated in the post-match TV interviews. But now he will have to sit out of two vital league games this week as the battle for the Absa Premiership title hots up. Matsatsantsa are currently in fifth position on the log with 37 points after 23 games, nine behind leaders Cape Town City, who have played an extra match. SuperSport will be without Baxter for Tuesday night’s huge showdown with second-placed Wits in Johannesburg, which is followed by another clash against Kaizer Chiefs – who are third on the league table – on Saturday in Nelspruit. Former SuperSport captain and current assistant coach Kaitano Tembo will take charge of the team in Baxter’s absence. Daily News
