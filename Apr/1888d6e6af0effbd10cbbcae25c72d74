The graduation ceremony was held yesterday at the institution’s Westville campus. “It is quite a good thing and I am excited. It encourages me to continue studying,” he said. The ANC provincial chairperson, who also has a degree in communication from the University of South Africa, said he had enrolled for a Masters in Commerce. “I am still preparing my topic that I will have to present in a few weeks,” he said. His research topic focused on the societal impact of dependency caused by social security grants. “What I learned is that the empirical evidence says people are not dependent on social grants and have babies to get grants. I learned that scientific endeavour and generalisations are two different things and that research is very important.” The support of his family was also important to him, he said. “I am normally a very busy man and sometimes I would come back home and have to tell them that I won’t be able to spend time with them as I have to study. They have been very understanding and have been supportive. They are also very happy about my achievement,” Zikalala said. For young people and those who are considering studying, Zikalala said it was important that people did not become complacent. “You must study and go forward,” he said. A person getting a job did not mean that they must stop improving themselves, he said. Daily News
