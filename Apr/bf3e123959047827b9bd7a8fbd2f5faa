The Delangokubona Business Forum, which has been threatening workers at  project sites around Durban demanding business stakes on site, said the revision proved that what they had been calling for was legitimate. Nathi Mnyandu, Forum spokesperson, said they were labelled thugs when they demanded stakes in big contracts around the province. “We don’t believe this is a stealing method by government and regarding those businesses that fund the ruling government, it is okay as long as it’s done in a systematic way that will not leave the poor poorer. “But we don’t wish to see these funding transactions done the way the government is doing with the Guptas,” Mnyandu said. The South African Minority Rights Equality Movement (Samrem) lashed out at the regulations, warning politicians not to “wake up one day with nothing to steal”. Advocate Ashwin Singh, Movement convener, said the regulations were just another way to steal more from the poor to “enrich and benefit” the political elite. “Politicians are going to be surprised to realise that black Africans are not actually stupid - this is just another ploy to bankroll more politicians and those connected to them. “They must not play the race card because we know there are crooked Indians who fund corrupt politicians. We as Indians make up only two percent of the population and all we want are equal opportunities, not tenders,” Singh said. He further took a swipe at what he called “politically connected” Indian businesses. “Provincial transport is the biggest department that funds the ANC. Politically-connected Indians take that money and fund the ANC. All of them might wake up one morning with nothing to steal,” he said. The Provincial Treasury is on a province-wide campaign to give workshops to officials from municipalities and government entities on the revised regulations promulgated on January 20, 2017. Daily News
