The guard died in a hail of bullets, while his colleague was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Garrith Jamieson, of Rescue Care, said the guard died before emergency teams arrived. “The second guard was stabilised by medics before being rushed to hospital,” he said. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesperson, said the SBV Services employees were depositing money at an ATM at the intersection of Dales Avenue and Moodie Street when the gang opened fire. “A 50-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene and an unlicensed firearm was found in his possession. An undisclosed amount of cash was also taken as well as the two security guards’ firearms. The suspects fled in their two vehicles,” he said. Zwane added that a Honda and a Mercedes were found abandoned in separate areas in New Germany. “Investigations also revealed that the Honda was hijacked in Phoenix this month and the Mercedes was hijacked in Newlands East. Charges of cash-in-transit (robbery), murder and attempted murder are being investigated by Pinetown police,” he said. Mark Barrett, of SBV, said they had set up a team that was working with police to apprehend the gang. “We take the loss of life seriously and do not tolerate any criminal activities. All our resources will be utilised to ensure that the individuals responsible for this violent attack are apprehended and brought to justice,” he said. He expressed his condolences to the dead guard’s family and hoped for a speedy recovery of the injured guard. “SBV Services is offering a reward for information leading to the successful arrests and conviction of the perpetrators,” said Barrett.
