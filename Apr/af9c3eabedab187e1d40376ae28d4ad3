DURBAN - Berea Primary School choir is headed to New York after setting the local scene ablaze. This after the school entered their choir into the KwaZulu-Natal regional aspect of Talent Africa. The choir did so well under the leadership of choir master, Sherwin Ganasen, that they made it to the nationals of Talent Africa in Roodepoort in April where they earned gold medals. This gave them the honour of being a part of the South African team that goes to Talent America in New York in July. Bridget Williams, the principal of Berea Primary School said she was proud of the school choir’s achievement. However, the school was now faced with the challenge of raising funds to send the choir to New York. “Obviously we are now in a completely different financial ball game, where we are not needing to raise tens of thousands but needing to raise in the millions to get our girls there. And so we would be very grateful for anybody who could assist us in any small way to help our girls to reach their dream of not only leaving Durban for the first time but leaving the country for the first time to represent South Africa overseas,” said Williams.
