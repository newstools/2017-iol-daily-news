Kwanele Ncalane, the department’s spokesperson, said the driver, who cannot be named until his court appearance, was driving with an expired driver’s licence and Professional Driving Permit (PDP). On Friday morning, the bus, with only female passengers, was travelling from Bulwer to Kranskop when the driver allegedly lost control, causing it to career off the road. The women were on their way to witness an umembeso, a traditional Zulu ceremony where the groom hands over gifts to his future bride’s family. The groom-to-be, Mbhasobhi Ngwadi, was driving in front of the bus and lost track of it. Later, he received a call to say there had been an accident. His mother, two sisters, three aunts, two cousins, three neighbours and a friend were among the dead. Daily News
