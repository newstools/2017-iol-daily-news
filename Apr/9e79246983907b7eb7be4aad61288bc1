In what has been a tumultuous week for the ruling party, with some members of the party’s national executive committee showing their disapproval over the axing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, battle lines may further be drawn. This comes as Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete prepares herself to deal with requests from the EFF and DA who seek for President Jacob Zuma to be impeached. Yesterday, Mbete returned promptly to the country after shortening her work trip to Bangladesh where she led a multi-party delegation to the 136th session of the International Parliamentary Union. She cited urgency as her reason for returning early. “The constitution clearly stipulates what should happen should the motion of no confidence be carried out. Our people are looking to Parliament to play its part. I therefore assure all South Africans that this legislative arm of the State will rise to the occasion. We understand the seriousness of the matter,” she said. Should the motion pass, Zuma will be asked to step down immediately. Mbete said she would hold consultations with ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and determine if Parliament could reconvene within time. Mbete has ruled out the possibility of secret ballots in the votes set to be passed in the motion of no confidence, saying only vast pressure from MPs would sway the rules. And while she has previously been criticised for protecting Zuma, Mbete came out guns blazing yesterday saying “show me the proof”. “What would be of great interest to me is if members of the media would go into detail about the protection of the president. This is an accusation that has been thrown to the point where I am interested where members of the media see this protection from,” she said.
