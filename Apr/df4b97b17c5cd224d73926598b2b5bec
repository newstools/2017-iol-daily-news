The erection of the 2.4m-high, barbed-wire topped fence comes just weeks after two cyclists were attacked by criminals lurking in the bushy areas nearby. Local ward councillor Shaun Ryley said there had also been a spate of attacks in the vicinity in January 2015. “Fortunately due to close monitoring of the area by Durban North SAPS, Marshalls security and the local CPF, the attacks stopped. When the issue resurfaced last month, I made a follow-up request for the fence to be erected and stated if nothing was done, it would seriously affect use of the cycle path which cost the city millions to install in the first place,” Ryley said. He added that his request for ClearVu fencing had been rejected in favour of a mesh fence. Earlier this month, a male cyclist was attacked by a knife-wielding man who pushed him off his bike. The incident happened at the Virginia Circle and Mackeurten Avenue intersection. The attacker and an accomplice then robbed the man of his bicycle which is believed to be worth R90000. This incident came less than two weeks before a female cyclist was accosted by two men who pushed her off her bicycle and dragged her down stairs below the M4 Ellis Brown viaduct. The attack was witnessed by a local businessman who chased off the two men. Speaking on the erection of the fence, the woman said she would like to thank the people involved in putting forward and approving the request. “I am so excited to see the fencing has been approved and that work has commenced. I really would like the area to be made safer for all pedestrians, runners and cyclists in the area. “I  know there have been a number of attacks in this area and it is vital for something constructive to be done as a way of moving forward towards greater security for all,” she said.
