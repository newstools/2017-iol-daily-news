The high court in Pretoria on Wednesday turned down his application to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to cling to his position. The application comes after the court last month ruled Ntlemeza’s appointment as head of the elite unit was irrational and unlawful. It was argued on his behalf that the court had erred in its ruling and that another court would come to a different finding. But three judges concluded that Ntlemeza’s application would have no prospects of success if heard by the SCA. The final blow to Ntlemeza came when the court granted an order in favour of the Helen Suzman Foundation that he had to step down now. Daily News
