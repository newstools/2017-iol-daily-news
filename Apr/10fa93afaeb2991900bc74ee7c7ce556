Yesterday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane announced that the party’s federal executive (Fedex) had decided to institute formal disciplinary proceedings against Zille on recommendations by the federal legal commission. Addressing a media briefing in Cape Town, Fedex chairman James Selfe said there was no need to place Zille on suspension. "Our party suspends members ordinarily when they are going to interfere with an investigation or intimidate witnesses. "This is not the case in this investigation,” Selfe said. But, the ANC described the move as proof Zille was above her party. ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs said the DA had missed an opportunity to show the gravity of Zille’s praising of colonialism, by allowing her to continue advancing colonial and divisive plans through the might of government. “The DA’s decision to take Zille to a party disciplinary committee fails to bring a measure of relief to the people she has offended, especially if she still enjoys the benefits of power, without any ensuing shame of her shameless act,” Jacobs said. Also Read But, Maimane told the media that Zille had a case to answer for her comments on colonialism as nobody was above the organisation. “I have respect for Premier Zille. She served this country with distinction. It would be incorrect to suggest she has not,” he said. “It would be incorrect to draw conclusions to say she is a racist,” Maimane said. Although Zille subsequently apologised, she defended her tweet during a debate in the Western Cape legislature as a “simple statement of fact”. Zille took to Twitter to confirm that she received an e-mail from Selfe on the decision to charge her after she was inundated with media requests for comment. “Whatever I hear from the DA I have only one comment: I will abide by due and fair process of South Africa and the constitution and the rule of law,” she said.
