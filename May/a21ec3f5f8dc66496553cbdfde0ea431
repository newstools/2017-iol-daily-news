DURBAN - SANParks urged residents in Komatipoort and adjacent areas in Mpumalanga to be cautious since five lions are believed to have escaped from Kruger National Park. A resident had reported sighting the five lions on the M4/ Mananga Road crossing in Komatipoort on Monday morning. Officials were alerted, who then went to chase the lions back into the park. However, it is believed that they managed to find their way back, but got lost in the sugar cane farms about 4kmâ€™s away from Kruger National Park. People were frequently warned not to take photographs of the lions because they can be very dangerous, and it is believed that they had already killed a cow. SANParks confirmed that two of the lions have been darted and that they hope to capture the remaining lions. Investigations are underway to find out how the lions managed to escape. SANParks request residents to report any sighting of the predators to authorities on 080010111, 0768019679 or 013 735 0197. However, as serious as this matter is, Tweeps took a serious matter and turned it into a hilarious one:
