The pill is connected to a thin tube that doctors use to inflate the balloon when it reaches the stomach. The tube is then removed. The balloon reduces the amount it is possible to eat. In an independent study of 10 overweight adults who received the gastric balloon, known as Obalon, the participants lost almost 13% of their body weight after six months, according to results presented at the Digestive Disease Week conference inÂ Chicago. The Obalon device naturally deflates after six months and is excreted. - Daily Mail <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/msALnQu4nUQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
