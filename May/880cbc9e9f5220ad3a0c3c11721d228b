Durban â€“ Motorists had to use alternative routes during peak traffic on Friday after protesters blocked off the M27 link road between Verulam, Umdloti and Umhlanga with burning tree logs, debris and tyres. Johnson Chetty, eThekwini ward 106 councillors said residents had taken to the streets because they wanted job opportunities from construction sites near Sibaya Casino. Chetty said several meetings were facilitated with the construction companies and job seekers in the past few weeks. Chetty said residents were made aware of the employment practices and were informed of the developer's intention to address the imbalances and involve them in the projects. Chetty said troublemakers were destabilising the negotiation process. Police were at the scene trying to reopen the road to motorists. Daily News
