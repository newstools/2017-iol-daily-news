Now a bidding war has started on Facebook after Karen Fortune Art International decided to sell one of its paintings to help raise funds to pay for Madida’s flights and other expenses to and from Switzerland, and to and from the BMX World Championships in America in July. Madida, who attends Margot Fonteyn High School in the Tshelimnyama settlement, near Mariannhill, is one of the development riders from Giba Gorge BMX who have been invited to attend a three-month training camp at the World Cycling Centre (WCC) in Switzerland, the home and training facility of world champions. “I am extremely excited to show off my talent on the world stage. I fell in love with the sport and there is nothing else I want to do at this stage in my life besides cycle,” he said. The painting on auction is of an old fire tower above Giba Gorge and its gallery price is R39000. Travis Goveia, chairman of Giba Gorge BMX, said Madida blossomed from their academy since he joined five years ago. “His coach, Tyrone Johns, spotted his talent from a young age, and through development funding provided by the club and KZN Development they have moulded the young rider into one of our next Olympic hopefuls,” Goveia said. Madida was selected after attending the Challenge Identification camp in Switzerland in October last year. Goveia said he had an amazing opportunity to train at the WCC where South African world champions Sifiso Nhlapo, Stephanie Hernandez and road racers Chris Froome and Daniel Teklehaimanot trained. Goveia said Madida hailed from a poor background and lived with his parents, three brothers and a sister. “I welcome the opportunity given to me. I intend giving it my best and getting to the finish line first. I would like to use this opportunity to motivate others to work hard,” said Madida. Daily News
