UPDATE: Durban – Durban's harbour resumed to full operations on Monday after strong winds prevented ships entering the harbour on Sunday However, Durban's port authority continued to monitor the adverse weather conditions that could effect ships from entering and leaving the harbour. Captain Alex Miya, Harbour Master of the Port of Durban, said some terminal operations were affected by the wind restrictions which apply to the operation of specific equipment such as harbour cranes. When wind speeds reach these limits, Miya said, operations are halted to ensure the safety of people and equipment. “Due to strong swells, the Port of Durban was closed to incoming vessels from 09h00 on Sunday, 14 May and for the remainder of the day. However outgoing vessels were still allowed to sail. As of the morning of Monday, 15 May shipping operations had returned to normal and there were no further disruptions,"he said. It is standard procedure for Port Control to closely monitor weather conditions, said Miya, and to advise the affected stakeholders when it is regarded unsafe to move vessels. Miya said Transnet National Ports Authority operations, including marine services, can be affected during heavy rain, strong winds and swells which can prevent the safe movement of vessels in and out of the port, depending on the vessel category. Miya said this could cause a backlog of vessels. Meanwhile, due to the high tides, Country Club and Thekwini beaches are closed until further notice, the Ethekwini Municipality said. Daily News
