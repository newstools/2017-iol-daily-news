The Tshwane Central Cluster Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit has been investigating the rape case since the victim reported it last week. The victim, from the eastern Pretoria township, told the police that he had boarded a minibus taxi in Solomon Mahlangu Drive bound for Pretoria last Friday. Inside the taxi were three young female passengers and the driver. He told the police he first noticed that something was wrong when the taxi’s route to town changed. He was ordered to sit in the front seat, and one of the women injected him with an unknown substance. He passed out. He woke up in an unfamiliar room on a single bed. The female suspects then allegedly forced the man to drink an energy drink, before taking turns raping him numerous times during the day. They used protection the entire time. The man’s ordeal lasted for two days, and he was dropped off in an open field in Benoni last Sunday afternoon. Police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said the man was very traumatised by his ordeal and had received medical treatment. She encouraged all victims of rape to report such crimes to their nearest police stations. “The SAPS takes all sexual offences seriously regardless of gender and assures all victims of these types of crimes that we will carry out robust investigations to bring offenders to justice,” she said. The suspects have yet to be found and investigations are still underway. The police called on anyone with information about the matter to assist the SAPS in their investigation. Information can also be shared anonymously by phoning 08600 10111. Pretoria News
