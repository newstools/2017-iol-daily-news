An ecstatic Sherryl Bradfield could not contain her excitement when her son’s cat was found by a neighbour, Kirsten McKinlay. “I was crying my eyes out with absolute joy and relief.” Her son, Justin, was also “over the moon”. Justin had rescued the cat from war-torn Afghanistan and got to like her so much that he brought her to South Africa on an Emirates Airlines flight for R150 000. He travelled with her to ensure she arrived safely in Durban. But last week, Nadia went missing. Bradfield and her son frantically searched for their beloved cat. They eventually put up a R1000 reward for anyone who found her. On Wednesday, McKinlay spotted Nadia in a nearby bush and noticed she had a paw trapped in her collar. She started to ask around for the owner, and met a man who had heard about the missing cat. He immediately called Bradfield who rushed to fetch Nadia. Back at her Morningside home, the famished Nadia gulped down four plates of food and a bowl of milk. Bradfield said McKinlay would donate the reward to an organisation that looked after abused and abandoned cats. Daily News
