Brazen armed robbers struck in broad daylight on Wednesday lunch-time and derailed the front gate of a house in Soofie Saheb Drive, said Blue Security media and community liaison officer Andreas Mathios. “The gang kicked open the front door and pulled the gardener inside the house with them. They then held up the resident, the gardener and a domestic worker at gunpoint before covering their heads with blankets,” Mathios said. “Then they went into a bedroom where they opened a safe. They stole cash, jewellery, a cellphone and a 9mm firearm and fled the scene in a grey Mercedes-Benz. “The gang removed a flat screen television from the house, but abandoned it on the property. No injuries were reported,” he said. Durban North SAPS attended the scene of the crime. In the second incident, two suspects broke into a property in Sylvania Place in Riverside on Wednesday night and fled when the owner awoke. “They jumped over a back wall and forced open the kitchen door and security gate to gain entry while the owners were asleep,” Mathios said. “The residents awoke when they heard noises in the lounge and the suspects fled with cellphones, laptops and other items.” Daily News
