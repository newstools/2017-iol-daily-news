Employees, including drivers and technicians, at most of the state mortuary facilities in the province have been on a go-slow for the past three months. They accumulated working hours after the shift roster was changed. The new roster apparently forced employees to work longer hours than expected and they were apparently not paid for the extra hours. Sfiso Dlamini, of the Public Service and Allied Workers’ Union, yesterday confirmed that the unions had signed the agreement. He said the issue of the roster had been discussed with the department, and would be amended to make sure that workers worked regular hours and were not exploited. Other issues on the list of demands, such as the relocation allowances and danger allowance, were still on the table. Phakama Ndunakazi, of the National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union in the province, said on previous engagements with the department, the issue of budget cuts by the Treasury was always an explanation given to the unions. Mortuary workers at Umkhanyakude District have been on a go-slow over the lack of protective gear. The department has declined to comment. Daily News
