DURBAN â€“ Judging by the flurry of activity on Twitter there is no doubt thatÂ Tweeps were following the Fikile Mbalula vs Berning Ntlemeza saga very closely. From the moment Mbalula filled the shoes of Police Minister he challenged Ntlemeza on his persistence of returning to his post as Hawks head.  The Ntlemeza issue turned into a Mbalula and Ntlemeza showdown. In one corner, Ntlemeza was adamant that he would return to work, while in the other corner, Mbalula was waiting for Ntlemeza to make his move. Ntlemeza had refused to vacate his office, even when the high court had turned down an application submitted by Ntlemeza to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein in a bid to keep his position. At one point, Mbalula asked acting national police commissioner Johannes Phahlane, to collect everything that belonged to the state that was in Ntlemezaâ€™s possession.  On Thursday, after weeks of court visits, Ntlemeza lost his court bid to return to his post. The High Court in Pretoria found that his application was not pressing and struck the matter from the roll. However, as serious as the matter is, Tweeps could not let Ntlemeza walk away from the situation unharmed. These tweets will shed some light on how Tweeps view the Ntlemeza saga:   #Ntlemeza ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/YTQ94qKIGx  â€” Nkateko (@Machayisanii) May 18, 2017   Berning #Ntlemeza looking at Pastor Mboro like: pic.twitter.com/QrHSkUMWOd  â€” IG: @AdvBarryRoux (@AdvBarryRoux) May 18, 2017   When you've just won a case against #Ntlemeza & getting ready to brag about it on Twitter.#Hawks pic.twitter.com/wZXcXmUA33  â€” Hloni Nyetanyane (@HloniNyetanyane) May 18, 2017   The Pretoria Urgent Court when #Ntlemeza tried to pull a #BrianMolefe pic.twitter.com/4CRflnV8gV  â€” Adv Huli Ramukhesa (@HaleKutter) May 18, 2017   @MbalulaFikile mood right now.
