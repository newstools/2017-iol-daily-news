Harare â€“ President Robert Mugabe arrived in Durban late Tuesday for the 27th World Economic Forum for Africa. Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa accompanied Mugabe. Chinamasa is in an optimistic mood given that Zimbabwe recently secured a US$1,7 bn loan to pay off the World Bank and African Development Bank which will help Zimbabwe rejoin the International Monetary Fund to secure further loans to repair infrastructure. The meeting in Durban will review the developmental models of developed nations and use them as a basis of creating new models of growth. Many expect Mugabe to spend more time in South Africa now that his two sons are no longer living in Dubai and are studying in South Africa. More then 1 000 delegates from 100 countries are expected to attend the forum. Foreign Service
