DURBAN - The SA Post Office released a set of five stamps which celebrate bee-eaters.  The Post Office celebrates statesmen, natural wonders and wildlife on its stamps, which are indigenous to South Africa. Bee-eaters are some of Southern Africaâ€™s most beautiful and interesting birds, and this made them perfect for stamps. Chris van Rooyen took the photographs that can be seen on the stamps, and the stamps were designed by Philatelic Services. Stamp collectors and bird lovers are expected to snap up the stamps. Bee-eaters are incredible. They catch insects in flight, dig tunnels in sandbanks in which they lay their eggs and like most species, the younger ones remain with their parents to bring up the next generation. Only later do they become independent. The stamps are made up of the little bee-eater, Southern carmine bee-eater, swallowtail bee-eater, the European bee-eater and white-fronted bee-eater. The stamps are valid postage for A5-sized envelopes and a set of five will cost R47.75. (R9.55 each). They will be available at all major post office branches and can also be ordered from sa.stamps@postoffice.co.za.
