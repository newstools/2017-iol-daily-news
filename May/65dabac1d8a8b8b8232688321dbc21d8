JOHANNESBURG- FIFA president Gianni Infantino has conveyed a message of condolences to the South African Football Association (SAFA) following the recent passing of former Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs coach Jeff Butler. â€œPlease accept my deepest condolences on the passing away of the former coach of Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs Jeff Butler," said Infantino in a letter addressed to SAFA president Danny Jordaan "On behalf of the members of the international football community, I would be grateful if you could extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. We hope that, in some way, our words of support may help bring a little bit of peace and solace in this time of sadness." Butler arrived at Chiefs in 1988 and the following year won the now-defunct JPS Knockout as well as the league title. Some of the trophies he won during his stint with Amakhosi include the BP Top Eight, the Ohlsson's Challenge as well as the Charity Spectacular. He was also appointed head coach of Bafana Bafana but only stayed for a brief period. African News Agency   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
