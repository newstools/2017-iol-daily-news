DURBAN – A new tug, built in Durban for Durban, has rolled off the production line and this morning, the city’s First Lady, Mayor Zandile Gumede launched her. And in true maritime tradition that dictates that a new ship has a woman “sponsor” or Godmother, the mayor cracked open a bottle of champagne on the side of the tug to christen her and bless her on her way. The new tug, called Umbilo (after the river that flows through the city), is part of Transnet National Ports Authority’s (TNPA) sixth tug in a fleet of nine over three-and-a-half years being made at Southern African Shipyards. The R1.4-billion tug contract is the largest ever awarded to a South African company for building a harbour craft. TNPA chief executive, Richard Vallihu, told guests that the new tug was exactly what the Port of Durban needed. “Over the past few years, we have seen larger vessels calling at the port. This has put a strain on our marine fleet...Having a new and a powerful tug in the port will release pressure on the port’s marine operations and speed up the turnaround times for vessels calling into the port,” he said. “If we improve efficiency and turnaround times, we can reduce the cost of doing business and begin to attract business from elsewhere.” The rest of the fleet is on time and on budget, he said.
