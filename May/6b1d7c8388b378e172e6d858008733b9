Bloemfontein â€“ Throngs of tripartite alliance supporters are trickling in at the Loch Logan Park ahead of the main May Day rally to be addressed by President Jacob Zuma in Bloemfontein. Zuma will deliver the keynote address at the main rally despite the unhappiness by some Cosatu unions including Nehawu, Samwu and CWU. The affiliates had argued that it would cause conflict and confusion and further weaken Cosatu for Zuma to address the rally, considering the labour federation's call that he step down. Meanwhile, security seems tight at the May Day rally venue, with everyone coming through screened by metal detectors. There is also a barricade fencing separating the main stage from where the supporters are.    The Sunday Independent reported that Zuma risked being booed if he went ahead and addressed the event. However, ANC Free State spokesperson Thabo Meeko said their comrades would be bussed to the event and "planted" across the venue to stifle any rowdiness.    The event is yet to get under way.     luyolo.mkentane@inl.co.za  Political Bureau
