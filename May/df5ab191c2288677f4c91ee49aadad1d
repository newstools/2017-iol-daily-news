It had cost R150 000 to transport the cat to Durban. Justin and Sherryl Bradfield are offering a R1 000 reward to anyone who can find their precious Nadia, a 3-year-old tabby Justin rescued from war-torn Afghanistan. His mother, Sherryl, said Nadia had been on their Morningside home’s verandah when she ran off. When the family realised 
Nadia was nowhere to be 
seen, they searched for her 
high and low. But the pet was nowhere to be seen. What the family fear most is that Nadia is confused because she is in unfamiliar territory. Although the missing cat was fitted with a chip for tracking purposes, the family have still not been able to locate her. They have contacted the SPCA  to see if anyone has handed her in, to no avail. “She has a loving personality, but she must be petrified and hiding somewhere,” Sherryl said. “I’m feeling terrible. It’s heart-wrenching. “We have to find her... “She has not eaten now for five days and we are desperate for her return.” She said her son was “completely and utterly sore and heartbroken”. Daily News
