These were buildings the owners had illegally altered to house tenants, a statement from the city said. The walkabout revealed “challenges such as illegal dumping, littering, damaged municipal infrastructure, unapproved building plans, illegal businesses and illegal street traders”, and Nzuza said the city was committed to addressing these challenges. “The renewal of our central business district is critical to maintain business confidence and investment. By addressing crime, grime and other social issues we will boost confidence in the city and enable our communities to thrive,” Nzuza said. “We want to attract investments into the city and we want the city to have an environment where people can live, work and enjoy our leisure facilities.” He urged people and businesses to work with the municipality to keep Durban clean. “We must reclaim the neighbourhoods and take the initiative by reporting any illegal activity or by-law infringement,” he added.
