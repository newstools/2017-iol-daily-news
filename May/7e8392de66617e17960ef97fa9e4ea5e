Anandrai’s bookkeeper Sanjay Singh said this in the Durban High Court on Thursday where seven people, some whom allegedly owed him money and are accused of hiring a hitman who killed him, were appearing for his murder. They allegedly lured Anandrai to a house in Chatsworth where he was shot in his vehicle before it burst into flames. The hitman, Gregory Pillay, currently serving an 
18-year prison sentence for shooting Anandrai, claimed he was hired by the accused. Dhanaseelan “Dhevan” Manickam, Claude Reginald, Rajendran Chetty, Shana Mangroo, Sudesh Ghooruhoo, Veronica Rathilal and Jayshree Baijnath stand accused of Anandai’s murder. Advocate Singh told the court that Baijnath, who was Anandrai’s lawyer, and her husband, Ashwin, who was the money lender’s advocate, owed Anandrai R675000 in loans they jointly took. Singh said clients were normally charged interest, but Baijnath was never charged interest. He said he recorded payments on the dates that they  were made and at the time of Anandrai’s murder, Baijnath and her husband owed him a lot of money. Loan records Baijnath’s lawyer advocate Clinton Pillay asked Singh why it was only Ashwin’s name that appeared in the loan records and not Baijnath’s also. Singh could not explain why he only recorded Baijnath’s husband’s name if the loan was jointly taken. Pillay put it to Singh that the only reason why it was Ashwin’s name against the loan was because Baijnath had long paid off her debt at the time Anandrai was killed. “She even approached the deceased in 2013 to make it clear she was not liable for Ashwin’s debt. It was your evidence that the clients were made to sign for the loans, (and) according to your records, Baijnath never signed. “They were attorneys and he trusted them; that is why he would just issue them with money and did not make them sign for it,” said Singh. Pillay said the R675000 was solely Ashwin’s debt and that Baijnath did not owe anandrai any money at the time of his death. Daily News
