It is believed he got into a fight with a group of boys from another school, after it was alleged that a friend of Sandile’s had raped the girlfriend of one of the boys in the group. The boys were dressed in school uniform and wearing Newlands East Secondary ties, although they were not from that school, according to witnesses. The gang went to the school and told pupils they were looking for Sandile. When they could not find him, they went to the soccer field. The boys spotted Sandile, who was with friends, and a fight broke out. During the fight, one of the assailants drew a knife and delivered the fatal blow. It is suspected  the knife pierced Sandile’s heart. A  teenager who knew Sandile, said she saw him running across the grounds. “I think he was in shock. He ran towards the end of the grounds then ran up the bank and towards one of the houses. “The woman closed the door and as he ran out of her yard, he collapsed. I placed pressure on the wound until the paramedics came,” she said. Thembinkosi Khumalo, Sandile’s father, said when he arrived at the scene, Sandile was still alive. “I hope that police find the boys responsible. “He was just 17 years old,” the distraught father said. Sandile leaves behind his parents and four brothers. Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Blood, Newlands SAPS Visible Policing Commander, said two teenagers had been taken in for questioning. A case of murder has been registered at Newlands SAPS. Daily News
