DURBAN -  Zimbabwe is not a fragile state, nor is it poor, but a well-resourced country, President Robert Mugabe said on Thursday on the second day of the World Economic Forum Africa in Durban. “We are not a poor country and we can't be a fragile country, I can call America fragile, they went with their knees to China,” he said. Speaking at the session themed Eye on Africa's Failing States, the statesman said the Southern African country had 14 universities and literacy rate at over 90 per cent. However, Oxfam's executive director Winnie Byanyima, in a veiled rebuke at Mugabe, said the problem is that African leaders were dictatorial.
