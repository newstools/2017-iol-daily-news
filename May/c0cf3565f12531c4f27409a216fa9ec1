DURBAN – Treepedia, a website that measures the green canopy or trees and vegetation of cities around the world, recently named three South African major cities in its Green Canopy Global Database. Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg, are the first cities to be named in Africa. Treepedia measures the canopy over cities by developing a scaleable and universally applicable method by analysing the amount of green perceived while walking down the street. However, it only maps street-level perception only, which means that parks are not included. The Green View Index (GVI) is calculated on a scale of 0-100, which shows the percentage of canopy coverage of a particular location. When looking at Durban, the city is at 23.7%, in a population density of 2 600/km2, in canopy coverage according to the Green View Index. Durban has a higher GVI when compared to Cape Town (13.4% – in a population density of 1 100/km2) and Johannesburg (23.6% – in a population density of 2 900/km2). The MIT Senseable City Lab in collaboration with the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on the Cities and Urbanisation developed Treepedia, which allows city residents to view the location and size of trees within their communities and submit input to help tag and track them. The ability of comparing them with other cities encourages support among residents to grow their green canopy. Trees are an important part of urban life. They help regulate extreme temperatures, provide temporary relief from traffic, noise and congestion and improve the quality of life for those living in urban areas. Treepedia aims to increase awareness of these benefits and encourages interest in maintaining and growing urban habitats. Treepedia was first launched in 10 global cities such as Geneva, Tel Aviv and Boston. Now it has grown with the addition of Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg – it now covers a total of 25 cities and hopes to cover more cities in the future. Daily News
