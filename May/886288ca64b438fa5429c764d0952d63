In a statement the organisation said: “We mourn the untimely death of our faithful comrade who remained committed and steadfast in the fight for the recognition of the worth of a black lawyer. “He passed on when we still expected more from him, especially in the transformation of the legal profession.” Moosa had been practising for nearly 34 years. The High Court advocate was a founding member of the National Democratic Lawyers’ Association and the founding chairman of the Durban branch of the Black Lawyers’ Association (BLA), and was its secretary when he died. BLA president Lutendo Sigogo lauded Moosa’s contribution to freedom in South Africa, and said in a statement: “He was actively involved in the Struggle for the liberation of South Africa, he is known for his deep-rooted beliefs in the Black Consciousness ideology. “He was not only involved in the political activities and leadership, in his legal practice he was one of the leading human rights lawyers who represented political detainees often at his own expense.” It was not only in the courtroom where he had an impact, but also in academia. He was a published author and an editor of the Frank Talk and African Law Review journals. A memorial service for Moosa was held on Thursday at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Howard College campus.
