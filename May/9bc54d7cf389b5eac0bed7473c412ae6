DURBAN - Water restrictions will still remain in effect in the Durban area, despite several dams reaching 100% capacity in KwaZulu-Natal following a three day torrential downpour. The heavy rains came after a cold front passed over much of South Africa on Friday. Shami Harichunder, spokesman for Umgeni Water, which supplied bulk water to several municipalities across KZN said they were concerned about the consistently low level of Albert Falls dam, which is the largest dam in the Umgeni Water operational area. "This dam is dependent, in part, on Midmar to rise sharply. Midmar has to overflow for the level of Albert Falls to increase or there has to be significant amounts of rainfall in its catchment,” Harichunder said. Areas that receive their water from the Mgeni system are currently under 15% water restrictions. These areas are uMgungundlovu, Pietermaritzburg and Durban (except Verulam, Waterloo, Sea Tides and Tongaat) and these restrictions will remain until the situation improves. Harichunder said: “Water restrictions are always accompanied by a degree of hardship. But they are necessary to make limited water resources last until the next good rains. In the case of Mgeni system, the restrictions were applied to prevent failure of Midmar and Albert Falls. This could have occurred in May and November 2018 had we not adopted the strategy of water-use curtailment. The need to conserve water still remains.” An estimated 200m of rainfall was recorded in the south of Durban, while in the north of Durban, Hazelmere Dam received approximately 100mm. Hazelmere Dam currently sits at 101% and Maphumulo iMvutshane Dam is at 101,35%, both these dams are overflowing. The following amounts of rainfall were received in the Mzinto system (Middle South Coast): Amanzimtoti 160 mm Mtwalume 167 mm Umzinto 160 mm Mhlabatshane 153 mm The four dams – Umzinto, Nungwane, EJ Smith and Mhlabatshane – which serve the Middle South Coast are at levels in excess of 100% and overflowing. Harichunder, said the largest of the systems in Umgeni Water operational area, Mgeni, still remains under stress as it did not benefit to any significant degree from weekend rainfall. Levels of dams in the Mgeni system as at Monday, 15th May 2017: Midmar = 79, 08% (an increase of 0, 41% from Friday, 12th May 2017) Albert Falls = 33, 5% (an increase of 0, 1% from Sunday, 14thMay 2017 Spring Grove = 85, 86% (an increase of 0, 13% from Friday, 12th May 2017 Mearns= 89, 99 % (increase of 8, 91% since Friday, 12th May 2017 Nagle = 73, 4% (an increase of 5, 79% over past six days) Inanda = 65, 3% (increase of 0, 5% over past six days) Home Dam in Ixopo received a 3% increase and currently sits at 99,28%. Water restrictions of 40% in Ixopo have been restricted.
