The president of the SA Figure Skating Association, Enzo Daguanno, said this at the Durban Ice Arena, as the first day of the two-day championship got under way on Sunday. The event gave mothers time to spend with their daughters, who were trying for a spot in the national team, to represent the country internationally. Nine-year-old Tholi Langa, representing central Gauteng and who will skate today, said she was ready to teach her category a thing or two. “I trained too hard and I think I am ready to do my thing. I am honoured to be here,” she said. The sport was growing and South Africans were gathering a lot of international medals, the president said. “We are starting to see rewards. In the past five years, our athletes have brought home seven medals. It’s a wonderful sport that has parents involved,” Daguanno said. The categories range from juveniles (under nines) to seniors (18 years and older). Daguanno said the selection process for the international team would be based on the participants’ seasonal performances as well as their provincial achievements. “We are looking for an international acceptable standard. The judges will deliberate on their selection and announce the team in due course,” he said.
