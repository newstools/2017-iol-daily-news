DURBAN - Train commuters travelling between Durban, Umbogintwini,Isipingo and Kelso have been asked to seek alternate travel means after heavy rains disrupted services on the train line. Isabel van der Westhuizen of the Passenger Rail Agency SA’s said engineers were  busy repairing the damaged line. In the interim a shuttle service is running between Durban, Isipingo and Umbogintwini to Kelso. A bus service will transport commuters between Umbogintwini and Isipingo. PRASA Engineers are working on restoring the service but due to the nature of the damage, it is unknown as to how long repairs will take,” she said. Van der Westhuizen added that commuters will be transported as far as Jacobs station and will transfer to a bus service between Jacobs and Island View in both directions. “All other services are not affected, however the inclement weather is having an effect on PRASA trains and Infrastructure. The result is that delays and cancellations are unavoidable on daily basis. Commuters are to note that the current trains are old and in many cases have reached the end of their life cycle. The trains that are in use are unfortunately susceptible to failure,” she said. Whilst every effort is made to run this service as advertised, issues such as train failures, vandalism, theft and sabotage prohibit maintaining schedules. Commuters are further requested to refrain from venting their anger on PRASA staff, in particular, Train Crew and Station staff. Likewise destruction to PRASA property only results in less resources being available.It is recommended that commuters consider alternative transport if punctuality is critical to their travel.
