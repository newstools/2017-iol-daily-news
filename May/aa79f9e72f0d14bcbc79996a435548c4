The march, which was meant to start at 10am from the Durban City Hall eventually began more than an hour later. Hordes of ANC Youth League members were bussed in from wards around the city, all dressed in their ANC regalia and chanting pro-Zuma slogans. The march, organised by local musicians, called on the South African Broadcasting Corporation’s interim board to reconsider scrapping the rule. Last year, former SABC chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng implemented the rule which meant that SABC-owned radio stations had to play 90% local content. This ruling, however had an adverse effect, with the broadcaster losing hundreds of thousands of rand in revenue when advertisers pulled out. Speaking to the Daily News, jazz singer Simthandile Mtolo said although they were thrilled by the support shown by the ANCYL, the march had lost substance. “We wanted this march to speak specifically for local artists who would lose out if the ruling is scrapped. I can tell you that the KZN music industry has so many more artists who simply refused to come and march with us because they knew it would be used as a political platform,” she said. Before the march, Thokozani Zulu of KZN Arts said the march was not politically motivated nor was it to show support for Motsoeneng. “The march is about artists getting what they deserve,” said Zulu. Speaking after the march, he said he believed that the message of the march was, somehow, lost. “We sent an invite out and called on everyone to support us. We feel our message was still heard and no member of any political party handed over the memorandum of understanding,” said Zulu. The march concluded at the SABC studios where a memorandum of understanding was handed over to Ukhozi FM station manager Bonga Mpanza. The interim committee is expected to reach a decision by next week. Daily News
