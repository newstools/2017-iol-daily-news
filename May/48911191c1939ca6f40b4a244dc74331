DURBAN - The teacher accused of sending nude images and sexually-suggestive texts to a 14-year old pupil will have to wait until Wednesday to find out if the court will grant him bail. The teacher made his second appearance at the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. He was represented by Advocate Christo van Schalkwyk along with legal team members; Vishal Junkeeparsad and HK Gunase. In court, it was heard that the Investigating Officer in the case had not received the docket, nor was he aware that he had to be present in court today. Last week, during the teacher’s first appearance the State had opposed bail due to the teacher’s personal circumstances. At the time, the teacher had not provided an address to the court. According to the State prosecutor, the IO was due to verify the teacher’s address that was recently provided. He failed to do so. The matter is due back in court on Wednesday where the teacher will make a formal bail application. The teacher faces a count of sexual grooming and displaying pornography.
