They also detailed how the Guptas prepared for Zuma to move his family to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. But Gupta family’s attorney Gert van der Merwe dismissed the reports, which are based on internal emails. “I invite the newsrooms relying on these documents to disclose them (and the sources from which it was ostensibly obtained) to my client for consideration and comment if possible.
