“Tafta is saddened by the loss of Elaine. She was the ­epitome of all we aspire to be and do at Tafta,” said the chief executive, Femada Shamam. “Her infectious smile, kindness and total love of life inspired people around her. She inspired active ageing. “Her love and passion for entertaining always had audiences smiling, clapping and nostalgically singing along to old favourites. She sang, danced and loved all that life had to offer.” As the pioneer of popular entertainment group, The Tafta Revellers, the vivacious and flamboyant Jennings was well known for bringing her charismatic flair to local stages and defying old age with decades of vibrant performances. Jennings joined Tafta as a service centre organiser at the Anna Conradie Service Centre on South Beach after moving to Durban from Johannesburg, where she had performed in professional ­theatre since the age of 12, touring with shows throughout South Africa and Zimbabwe (Rhodesia). Under her leadership, The Tafta Revellers performed at venues throughout KwaZulu-Natal, including the Durban City Hall and the Durban ICC. Daily News
