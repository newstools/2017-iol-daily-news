The Peterson family of Reiger Road were huddled in the lounge while the rain pelted down and the wind blew overhead. They had to scoop up water puddles with buckets to prevent the lounge from being flooded. Cardboard They put cardboard and towels at the doors to prevent water from entering the only room covered by the roof. Two of the four family members were having a nap last month when a neighbour started screaming that smoke was billowing from one of the bedrooms. Sylvia Peterson climbed through her window while her grandmother, Mary Peterson, 74, ran out the front door. The roof was on fire. The fire destroyed a room occupied by a relative, who was not at home. Neighbours filled up buckets with water and threw it on to the flames before the fire department arrived. This saved the lounge from being completely burnt. Pensioner Mary Peterson and her three relatives share what is left of the house after the fire raged through two bedrooms, the kitchen and ablution facilities. Peterson’s two grandchildren and her brother are living in the lounge. “It was very stressful and cold. We had to be on standby with brooms and buckets because the rain just pelted down. Neighbours have donated about 150 tiles and the councillor gave us bedding and groceries,” Peterson said. Ward Councillor Aubrey Snyman said he needed a skip bin to load the debris and rubble from the yard. He is arranging for a sponsor to help repair the roof because the family are unemployed. Daily News
