DURBAN is finally going to get a long-awaited world-class passenger terminal for visiting cruise liners. The project of the R215-million terminal will begin next May and be ready by October 2019. It will be designed, financed, constructed operated and maintained by KwaZulu Cruise Terminal Pty Ltd (KCT), a joint venture between MSC Cruises SA (a subsidiary of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA) and Africa Armada Consortium, a black empowerment partner. Richard Vallihu, the chief executive of the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA), opened the envelope Oscar movie style to announced the name of the successful bidder at the harbour on Tuesday. The port’s N-Shed had served as a makeshift cruise terminal for several years and “it was time to step it up a bit” with a fully-fledged world-class terminal, guests at the bid announcement ceremony were told. KCT had put together an exciting concept and had the experience to deliver a facility that would be the “jewel in the crown” of the port, Vallihu said. It would be an asset within Durban’s “smart people’s port” that would create more opportunities for surrounding communities to take part in the local economy. There will also be a training centre, which will be an MSC initiative, to train people for MSC cruise ships worldwide, said Ross Volk, the managing director of MSC Cruises SA, which already trains 120 people a year. The terminal will go up at A and B berths in the port (opposite the Lion Match Company at the Point) and as well as housing various government departments, it would also have a viewing deck for the public. Volk stressed that although MSC Cruises was behind the new terminal, it would be available for every other cruise ship that called into the city. Daily News
