DURBAN â€“ A 30-year-old man had to be airlifted to hospital on Wednesday after emergency services ambulances could not reach him and transport him to hospital quick enough due to the taxi protest that clogged most of the main arterial routes in the city. Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security, said three people were critically injured when a Nissan bakkie crashed into a heavy-goods truck. The incident took place on the N2, near uMdloti. "The three occupants of the bakkie were entrapped in the twisted wreckage. The jaws of life were needed to cut the occupants free from the wreckage. Advanced life support intervention was needed to stabilise the three men..." said van Reenen. He said that the third occupant was in a critical condition and the Department of Health Red Cross Air Mercy Services helicopter was called for to airlift the man to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital, where a team of trauma surgeons were put on standby for his arrival. Van Reenen said the other two men who were not as seriously injured were taken to hospital by ambulance. Daily News
