Gilmour will now represent South Africa at the next world long-boarding championships alongside Thomas King, 
the winner of the open men’s title. Another Durban schoolgirl who also made her parents proud during the week-long surfing extravaganza was Brittany Gadd from Hillcrest High School. She was among winners of the Roving Reporters 2017 Soul Surfer Awards in aid of marine conservation and education. Presented by Andries Botha, chairperson of the Human Elephant Foundation, the awards aim to engage surfers as Ocean Watch ambassadors in educating people about critical issues affecting the health of our oceans. “The oceans contribute to our everyday lives, either directly or indirectly, not only for us ocean lovers, but for everyone - even if you don’t realise it,” said Gadd, who was awarded a whale watching tour by the World Cetacean Alliance. *  Roving Reporters Ocean Watch series is supported by The Blue Fund - a joint 
initiative of Grindrod Bank and Wildlands that promotes marine conservation projects.
