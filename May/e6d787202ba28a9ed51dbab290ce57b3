Prem Balram, owner of private security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said worshippers were robbed of cash, keys and cellphones by the armed men. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said officers did not know the exact number of robbers that entered the premises, which consist of a mosque and a separate double-storey living quarters for employees and their families. Balram said 10 suspects were seen on the premises, some carrying  AK-47 rifles and pistols. He said the robbers had taken a mosque employee’s son to his home at the back and placed a gun in his mouth. They knocked and demanded that the boy’s father open the door. When the father opened it, the men rushed in and ransacked the house before fleeing in a white Ford Bantam bakkie. An employee of the mosque, who declined to be named, said the family was shaken but not harmed. They had found a few cellphones and a set of car keys that the robbers had dropped while fleeing. The mosque is about 5km from the Verulam Central Business District. A  case of business robbery was opened at Verulam police station. No arrests were made. Daily News
