DURBAN â€“ Three men were arrested and a firearm cache recovered following a high-speed chase from Verulam to KwaMashu on Tuesday. Officers from Reaction Unit SA were alerted to a call of a hijacking in Verulam. "As Reaction officers approached the premises the suspects abandoned the theft and fled the scene in an awaiting Toyota Corolla. A high speed chase ensued resulting in the suspects colliding into several motorists in an attempt to evade arrest. RUSA Officers from Phoenix joined the chase into KwaMashu," said RUSA's Prem Balram. He added that the RUSA Robinson R44 helicopter took off from Verulam and maintained visual from the sky of the getaway vehicle that was travelling at speeds in excess of 180 km/h. "Reaction Officers managed to box the vehicle in on Malendela Road in KwaMashu. The three occupants of the vehicle were placed under arrest. A search of the vehicle revealed an unlicensed CZ 83 firearm with its serial number filed off. The pistol was found stuffed inside a loaf of white sliced BB bread. A magazine containing 2 live rounds of ammunition was also found in the boot of the vehicle," Balram said. It was established that the vehicle used in the getaway was contracted to Uber.
