Zakaria Khan, 22, remains in a medically-induced coma while his wife, Maseeha, 20, and his grandmother, Sara-Bibi Khan, 70, sustained serious injuries when shrapnel from the package hit them on their faces and legs. The package was delivered to their home in Stephen Dlamini (Essenwood) Road just after lunchtime on Friday. It is alleged that the Khans’ father, Saleem, was the target of the “hate crime”. Zakariah also lost his thumb and two fingers. Traffic was brought to a standstill on the usually busy road while police, the bomb squad and paramedics rushed to the scene. Garrith Jamieson, spokesperson for Rescue Care, said by the time they arrived, the three relatives had been rushed to hospital. Concealed It is believed the bomb was carefully concealed in a flower package that arrived with a card that read, “Get well soon mom”. Khan opened the card and that allegedly triggered the bomb. Jamieson said a second bomb was found a few hours later, and police returned to the scene. “There was a controlled detonation handled by the explosives unit,” he said. Nawshaadh Khan, a relative and family spokesperson, said the family was reeling from the attack. A source alleged that this was possibly the third attack on Saleem Khan, an insurance broker. The source claimed Khan had formerly lived at another property on Stephen Dlamini (Essenwood) Road, and had come under attack. Earlier this year, two of Khan’s cars were set alight while parked in the garage. Nawshaadh declined to 
comment on the previous incidents. He merely confirmed the arson attack happened in 2017. “We are only focusing on what happened on Friday.” Nawshaadh said the family was considering beefing up ­security at the home. Meanwhile, the Hawks are remaining tight-lipped about the investigation. Daily News
