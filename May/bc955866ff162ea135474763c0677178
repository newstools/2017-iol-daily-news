Siyaya Mvelo, of Vryheid, said he was extremely happy to be graduating on Friday. The path to this remarkable achievement was not easy. “My mother is a domestic worker and my grandmother is a pensioner,” Mvelo said. “I went to Gelekedle Secondary School, which is deep in a rural area. If teachers saw that you had potential, they encouraged you to become a teacher and go to the nearby University of Zululand. “But I didn’t want to be a teacher. I wanted to do something different,” he explained. The 22-year-old matriculated with four distinctions in 2012. But that did not mean his hardships were over or that he would easily get a place at a tertiary institution. “When I first came to Durban, all I had was a blanket and the determination to do well.” He went to the institution and applied to do a diploma in auditing. “I like auditing because it teaches you how to do the right thing,” Mvelo said. He applied for funding from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, but the money did not immediately come through, which meant he did not have accommodation. “I ended up sleeping in the library for a week and had to make sure I was not caught by the security guards. I did not tell my mother about my situation because she would have told me to come back and I did not want to worry her,” he said. A determined Mvelo told himself he would have to study hard because the person he would be hurting if he failed was himself. He would also be disappointing his mother and grandmother who had sacrificed to provide for him. Mvelo became a part-time tutor as a result of his good marks. From the money he saved, he was able to bring his mother and grandmother to Durban for Friday’s graduation and pay for their stay in a lodge. Daily News
