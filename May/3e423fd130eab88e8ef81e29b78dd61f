But many of the highlights were courtesy of luminaries who channelled honouree Rei Kawakubo, including Rihanna, right, encased in fluttery petal-like pieces by the Japanese designer. Rihanna gestured to the crowd from the carpet in her Commes des Garcons look with stagey pink on her cheeks. Her outfit was a 
two-piece, and a sliver of stomach peeked out from the freewheeling design. Vogue’s Anna Wintour kicked off the gala a bit earlier as one of the evening’s co-hosts. She opted for encrusted gold and ostrich feathers from Chanel and said of Kawakubo and her brand: ‘She’s a genius. Not only does she think outside of the box, she doesn’t acknowledge the box.’ Priyanka Chopra’s floor-sweeping trench coat evening gown in camel from Ralph Lauren, left, took up a lot of real estate on the carpet, which is actually blue this year. - ANA-AP/Reuters
