Zuma was addressing journalists gathered in Durban for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Africa meeting being held from Wednesday to Friday, May 3-5. Zuma was talking to media after completing a walkabout with Elsie Kanza, the WEF's Head for Africa, in advance of the WEF meetings at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban. At first, an apparently composed Zuma had insisted that he was not upset by the incident at the Congress of South African Trade Unions event in Bloemfontein on Monday, saying: "You people don't really understand what democracy is. Democracy gives people the right to debate and express themselves democratically." However, he became visibly annoyed and began to dismiss questions, before he was ushered away by a large contingent of minders. AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
