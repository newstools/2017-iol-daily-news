Cape Town – The magical event called AfrikaBurn took place out in the Tankwa wilderness last week, with all its usual ingredients of performance art, pumping music, peace-pipe-smoking and red-hot fun. AfrikaBurn has been taking place annually in the semi-desert Tankwa Karoo, since 2007, and is centred on the construction of temporary artworks some of which are burnt towards the end of the event. Many of the attendees wear out-of-this-world costumes and create and decorate vehicles, amongst other things. The festival adheres to the 10 principles of Burning Man, including the “leave no trace” philosophy, and gets its name from the ritual burning of a large wooden effigy. IOL
