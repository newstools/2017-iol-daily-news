John Rudling was spraying crops when his Robby 22 was believed to have hit an overhead power line and crashed. Glen Preston, of Med-Evac, said Rudling was the single occupant of the helicopter and died at the scene. He was described as the ‘best chopper pilot and instructor ever’. Residents took to Facebook to express their shock at Rudling’s death. A team from the Civil Aviation Authority visited the scene yesterday and would investigate further. Police have lodged an inquest. Picture: Glen Preston / Med-Evac
