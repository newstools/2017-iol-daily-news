Con Roux, the N3 Toll Concession commercial manager, said by 2.30pm yesterday 2700 vehicles an hour were travelling north-bound between the Mooi and Tugela toll plazas. “There was an 11km traffic back-up at Tugela Plaza causing extensive delays and pressure on traffic resources,” he said. The high traffic volumes caused congestion and dangerous driving conditions on Van Reenen’s Pass between Ladysmith and Harrismith. About 1700 vehicles can safely be accommodated at a time on the Van Reenen’s section of the N3 toll route. “In the interests of overall road safety, the flow of traffic was managed at the Tugela Plaza by law enforcement authorities. Lanes had to be closed. Drivers of heavy vehicles were warned not to overtake on sections of Van Reenen’s Pass,” Roux said. All N3 toll plazas were operating at maximum capacity. A pedestrian was knocked down near Mooi Plaza which added further pressure on traffic flows. - Daily News
