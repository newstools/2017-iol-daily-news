Durban A prominent Durban family are still awaiting details about their son, who they presume died in Syria, on Tuesday. Crime activist Yusuf Abramjee, who broke the news on his Twitter account this week, said he was also waiting for further details. On Thursday, Ahmed Paruk of the Islamic Burial Council in Durban, who is in contact with the Durban man s family, said they were not sure of the finer details surrounding the allegations. The man s father has not received any confirmation from the South African embassy or Syrian officials. He is getting second-hand information from humanitarian agencies in Syria. For now, it s mere speculation. The area we are focusing on is war-torn and in some instances has no access, Paruk said. Nelson Kgwete, Department of International Relations and Co-operation spokesperson, said they had yet to receive any information and were still investigating.
