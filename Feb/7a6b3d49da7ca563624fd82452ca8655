Durban - Glebelands Hostel residents are living in fear and some whistle-blowers have threatened to stop co-operating with the police after the killing of yet another murder witness. The murder of Mlungisi Cele on Friday night has brought the number of people killed at the crime-stricken hostel to 73. The 38-year-old man witnessed his girlfriend Akhona Njokana s murder a week ago when she was gunned down, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend. Cele was apparently the key witness.Last week, the police confirmed that the suspect had handed himself over to the uMlazi police. A well-placed source at the hostel said after Njokana s murder, Cele feared for his life and felt that he would be targeted by the suspect s friends at Block57 where he was staying.The source said Cele had moved to BlockN for safety reasons. He was gunned down at the uMlazi Mega City intersection.The source said Cele had given a statement to the police after last week s shooting and was shot to allegedly silence him.He is not the first murder witness to be silenced at Glebelands Hostel.Sipho Ndovela, a key witness who was going to testify against a hostel warlord, was shot dead at the uMlazi Magistrate s Court on May 18, 2015. Makhosi Zide, who witnessed her uncle Mlindelwa Gobidolo s murder, was shot dead in December 2015.A community activist, Vanessa Burger, said Glebelands murder witnesses did not have long life expectancies. Evidence It is easy to ensure that there is insufficient evidence in the docket if the witness is dead, a tactic that also efficiently deters others from seeking justice, she said.Both Burger and the source blamed the police for failing to put witnesses under police protection.They said judging from previous incidents, police should have placed Cele under protection immediately.An interim report after an investigation by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, released last year, revealed that the SAPS, metro police, the Department of Social Development and the eThekwini Municipality had allowed the situation at Glebelands Hostel to escalate, leading to a trail of death and trauma.Her investigation also found that police failed to protect the residents of Glebelands Hostel and recommended that the government stop the carnage. Kwanele Ncalane, the provincial Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison spokesperson, urged residents to continue to assist the police with information to end the killings.He said the department was worried about the killing of witnesses, and the pattern used by criminals to eliminate these witnesses.He said the department was discussing the matter with the National Prosecuting Authority and the police to arrange for the Glebelands murder witnesses to be placed under police protection. We are working on stopping (the killing) because it was about to reach a situation where we are going to have criminals getting away with murder due to unsolved cases after the killing of witnesses, he said.Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said police were investigating.Daily News
