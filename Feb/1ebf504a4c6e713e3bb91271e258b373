Durban - It is feared that the xenophobic violence playing out in other parts of the country could lead to attacks against foreigners living in KwaZulu-Natal, and Mxolisi Kaunda, the MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, has called for peace between foreigners and locals. Last week, KZN police were on high alert following reports of a march in Pretoria. Kaunda, who is also the chairman of the KZN Inter Ministerial Committee on Xenophobia, said concerns were raised by representatives of the foreigners in Durban at the weekend. South Africa and KZN were part of the global community and respected UN prescripts on how we should relate to foreign nationals, including some fleeing conflicts in their home countries, said Kaunda.There was no reason for violence between locals and foreigners, he said. Premier Willies Mchunu has said time and again that foreign nationals are our brothers and sisters. We, therefore, should do everything possible to ensure that we co-exist with them peacefully, he said.The MEC said it was illegal to attack foreigners for whatever reasons . Those acting illegally, he said, would be dealt with by the police and would be treated as ordinary criminals. Last week, police arrested 136 people over 24 hours in connection with crimes including the looting that took place in Atteridgeville and Pretoria West on Friday. Violence had preceded the march in Pretoria against foreigners.The violence followed attacks in Rosettenville, Joburg, where angry residents burnt foreigners homes, claiming they were being used as drug dens and brothels. Yasmeen Rajah, director of Refugee Social Services, said: We ve seen the social media messages but there haven t been any direct reports. Should direct threats be received, they would speak to community leaders.Daily News
