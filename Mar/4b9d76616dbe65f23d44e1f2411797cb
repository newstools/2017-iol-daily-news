Although police could not say on Sunday if it was the same notorious “hammer gang” which was back in action, the robbery at Arthur Kaplan jewellers in Gateway comes just two months after the gang struck at the Osiniq Jewels shop inside the Hilton Hotel, getting away with R20 million worth of jewellery. A day after the Osiniq robbery, five men armed with crowbars and hammers made off with branded watches from Cajee, a jewellery store in Gateway. On Thursday night, robbers broke down the door to the Arthur Kaplan’s, a jewellers that sells such top-drawer watches as Rolex. The alarm was triggered as the gang battered their way through the glass door at 9.10pm, one hour and 40 minutes after the shop had been closed, and the alarm 
activated. Watches were snatched, but a spokesman told a Daily News reporter on Friday that they had not included Rolexes. He was unable to give further details on Sunday “as the investigation is continuing”. Daily News
