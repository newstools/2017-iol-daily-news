Durban – Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo swopped his suit and tie for a pair of scrubs and scalpel when he took up duty at a South Coast-based mortuary this week. Desmond Motha, Health Department spokesperson, said the bulk of staff at the Park Rynie Mortuary did not report for work, all claiming to be ill. Dhlomo, a forensic pathology practitioner by profession, cancelled his busy schedule and undertook eight post mortems on Tuesday. The bodies were transferred from the Park Rynie Mortuary to the Port Shepstone Mortuary. Dhlomo said, “I am happy to have been joined by members of the South African Police Service in this task. They are very competent and qualified for this as they previously conducted post-mortems until the task was transferred to the Health Department.” Dhlomo assured families of the deceased that bodies would be ready for burial by the weekend. There was no further details on the number of staff who failed to report for work. Daily News
