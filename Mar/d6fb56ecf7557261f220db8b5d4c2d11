Before Friday, motorists travelling on this route had paid R11 at Marianhill, R43 at Mooi River, R62 at Tugela, R58 at Wilge and R42 at De Hoek toll plazas. With Sanral’s hikes, motorist now must pay R46 at Mooi River, R66 at Tugela, R62 at Wilge and R44 at De Hoek toll plazas. In a statement explaining the increases, Sanral said: “The toll tariffs on national roads will be adjusted in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on March 3, 2017. “Adjustments to the tariffs are based on the preceding 12 months' Consumer Price Index and for this financial year, the average CPI adjustment for toll tariffs is 6.04%,” Sanral said. This, according to Sanral, did not constitute an increase because “the average inflation rate is used to determine the adjustments”. The roads agency also said there would be adjustments on the N4 between the Mozambican and Botswana borders and the toll road sections of the N1, N2, N17 and the R30. “The tariffs related to the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project will also be adjusted and there will be no adjustment of the Swartruggens toll plaza tariffs,” the statement read. Sanral said toll fees were used “prudently” to maintain and improve the road where tolls are paid. “Toll roads are built at no cost to the fiscus, as the concept of toll roads places the funding burden only on those who use the road,” the Sanral statement read.
