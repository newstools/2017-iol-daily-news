She said her ability to stay true to herself helped her overcome the challenges associated with working in a male-dominated industry. “This is a great achievement for me, to be awarded my medals. Some of the challenges I faced were instances where I was not given the same respect as male officers but my loving family has always supported me. “My husband is wheelchair-bound but he has never stopped me and has always been a great supporter.
