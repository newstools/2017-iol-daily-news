Prince Dube, 35, and Thando Sonqishe, 39, are allegedly part of a gang of seven suspected of being involved in what’s considered one of the country’s biggest heists. In Dube’s affidavit, read in court by his attorney, Oscar Machevele, he said he believed the State had no objective facts he committed the robbery. He said he was married with two children and lived in Norkem Park, in Kempton Park. His job paid him R400000 a month and he could pay R80000 bail. Sonqishe also denied being involved in the heist in his affidavit read in court by his legal representative Victory Nkwashe. He said he was married with two children and was self-employed. Sonqishe told the court he earned R30000 a month and could afford R10000 bail. The pair’s co-accused are expected to make their bail applications today. .- ANA
