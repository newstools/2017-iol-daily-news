WHEN an Air Seychelles plane touched down at King Shaka International Airport this afternoon, it marked yet another journey in the regionâ€™s plans to attract direct air connectivity. The arrival of Air Seychelles-which will operate a twice-weekly flight between Durban and the Seychelles-becomes the 10th airline to fly between the award-winning King Shaka International Airport and 11 regional and international routes. (Air Namibia flies from Durban to Namibia and also to Botswana). Air Seychelles has been flying non-stop to Johannesburg for more than 20 years-2 000 South Africans visited the destination last year-and now, with the additional direct flights from Durban, it will be offering seven flights and 544 return seats a week. Five other airlines are also code sharing with the airline on both the Durban and Johannesburg routes: Airberlin, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Etihad Aiways, Air Serbia and SAA. The twice-weekly Durban-Seychelles flights are on Thursdays and Saturdays. Daily News
