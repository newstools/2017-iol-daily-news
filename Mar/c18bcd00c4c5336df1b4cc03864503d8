Durban – Police have arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with a fatal stabbing at a Durban North restaurant on Saturday night. Two employees got into a fight in the kitchen at Republik, on the corner of Adelaide Tambo Drive and Broadway, when it is alleged the 22-year-old slit Sizwe Shange’s throat with a knife before fleeing. When emergency medical personnel arrived at the restaurant, Shange had succumbed to his injuries. Kyle van Reenen, spokesperson for Marshall Security, said there was nothing paramedics could do to save Shange. Captain Nqobile Gwala, SAPS spokesperson, confirmed that the police had opened a case of murder and the 22-year-old was arrested hours later. It is unclear what the fight was about. Republik management was unavailable for comment. However, a statement was released via the eatery’s Facebook page. “To our loyal customers who were there last night, we are truly sorry. To our incredible staff, thank you for all you tried to do for your colleague. To lose our longest-standing employee, our head griller, a good, kind and hard-working man is devastating but to lose him at the hands of someone we briefly considered as one of our own, is indescribably heart-wrenching.” Republik patrons used the restaurant’s Facebook page to share messages of condolences to management and those who knew Shange. Meanwhile, police are investigating a case of murder after the shooting of a deputy principal at the Laduma High School in Pietermaritzburg at the weekend. The woman was teaching classes when two armed men entered the classroom. Police said the victim was shot multiple times before the men fled. No arrests have been made and investigations continue.
