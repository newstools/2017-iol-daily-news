Edith Langeler, who came to Tafta’s help in the organisation’s hour of need many years ago and rescued it from closure, remembered Tafta in her will. And her generous legacy was enough to kick-start a much-needed brand-new residential complex for the elderly, which has now been named Langeler Towers in her honour. Various donors and sponsors, coupled with help from KZN’s Department of Human Settlements, which was the biggest donor - also contributed and “turned this dream into a reality”, said Margie Smith, the chief executive of Tafta, a provider of care focusing primarily on the needs of the elderly and vulnerable groups in Durban. The 11-storey tower block with the bedrooms providing unsurpassed views of the ocean and which is now home to 900 pensioners, was designed to respond to the housing needs of people on low incomes, while providing supportive services. There are various sized flatlets, which will be rented out on a “per bed” basis. They range from single units to those that offer a sharing option. Tafta explained that the development sought to address the continued demand for security and affordable accommodation for pensioners, who are hard hit by social abuse, abandonment, lack of access to healthcare as well as the impact of HIV/Aids. Langeler Towers was built on a vacant plot on Durban’s South Beach, which was previously rented from the municipality as a recreational space for the elderly. “It was identified as an ideal site for the complex due to its location, offering elements of relaxation, tranquillity and comfort as well as easy access to public transport and government hospitals,” Smith said. It links to Tafta’s neighbouring fully renovated John Conradie House and has access to a newly-designed frail care unit and an assisted living unit. Facilities include a coffee shop, beauty salon, laundromat, convenience store, library and a service centre that offers a wide range of activities. Daily News
