Accompanied by Umhlabuyalingana mayor Nkululeko Mthethwa and religious 
leaders, an emotional MEC Dhlomo expressed his sadness and held prayers at the Makhaye family home at Manguzi, near the Mozambican border, on Saturday. Calling on the family to be strong and have faith in God during this time, Dhlomo said that the remains of the students would be repatriated to South Africa towards the end of next week. This would be done once the post-mortems were completed. The bodies would be embalmed, and then transported to France, from where they would be flown to Johannesburg, and then to KZN. With no one permanently employed, the large Makhaye family had pinned its hopes on Cebo, a fifth-year student, who was due to return home next July, complete his 18 months’ experiential training, and then graduate as a doctor. Makhaye and his friend, fourth-year student Sibusiso Thanks Ngeleka, had been attending a birthday party at a private house in Havana, the capital of Cuba, when the tragedy occurred. It is alleged that at some point, they decided to go and “cool down” in the swimming pool. When they did not return, their friends started a frantic search for them. After Cebo was discovered in the pool, he was rushed to hospital, but he died on the way there. Ngeleka was already dead when he was found in the pool. The incident has left the students shocked and has caused devastation back home. Daily News
