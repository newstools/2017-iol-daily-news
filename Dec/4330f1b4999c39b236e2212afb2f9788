The men - Sergeant Bhekukwazi Mdweshu, 37, Vukani Mcobothi, 25, Khayelihle Mbuthuma, 32, Wonderboy Mhlope, 37, Matlala Mdweshu Ntshangase, 35, and Mahliphiza Mkhize, 28 - appeared before uMlazi magistrate Gwyneth Cele on Wednesday. Violence at the uMlazi hostel has thus far claimed at least 100 lives. Before court proceedings began yesterday, a crowd of people including friends and family of the six men tried to fit into the small court room. A  strong police presence, including officers armed with semi-automatic rifles and bullet-proof vests, ensured crowd control as everyone squeezed in. State advocate Sipho Magwaza said the State wanted the matter to be heard at a regional court due to its complexity and said he would be ready to proceed on January 3. Magwaza said the provincial deputy director of public prosecutions’ office would be handling the matter from there on. Defence attorneys argued against the postponement, saying it would be a huge injustice against the accused as they have been in custody for nearly two weeks. “The State should have had its house in order. This delay would be costly to our clients,” said Andile Dakela, representing four of the six men. Dakela argued that bail applications were generally quickly dealt with and the delay was not in this spirit nor in the interests of justice as the men’s rights were not being respected. The magistrate said it was a complicated matter. Cele added that the best course of action would be for the matter to be moved to Regional Court Two in uMlazi on January 4 and 5. The men would be remanded in custody until their bail hearing. Daily News
