No injuries were reported and paramedics stood by whilst the Durban Fire Department contained the blaze,” he said.   At this stage the cause of the fire is unknown however the necessary authorities were on the scene and will be investigating further. In a separate incident, eThekwini Municipality has called for an investigation into a fire that destroyed at least 80 shacks at the Kennedy Road informal settlement on Tuesday. At this stage, it is still unclear what has sparked the blaze as most residents whose shacks were destroyed by fire were away. However, there was a report from a community member that fire started from one of the shacks that was unoccupied and no person was injured.  Tozi Mthethwa, municipality spokesperson said Disaster Management Unit officials will conduct a proper assessment with a hope that most of the owners would have returned from holiday. Daily News
