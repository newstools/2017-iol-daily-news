The incident happened between the Berea Centre and the Musgrave area in 2012. The Durban Regional Court on Wednesday heard the closing arguments in both the State and defence cases. The case will resume again on March 4 when judgment will be given. Nzimande is facing charges of murder, defeating the ends of justice and contravening sections of the Road Traffic Act for failing to stop, failing to report the accident and failing to assist the injured. It is alleged that Phumlani Mbatha crossed King Dinizulu Road on April 14, 2012, to speak to a friend outside Berea Centre when he was struck by a blue VW Polo speeding through a red traffic light. Nzimande allegedly continued driving with his body on the roof of her car until dropping it off on Silverton Road. Nzimande’s co-accused, US national John Solomon, who lives in South Africa, is facing charges of defeating the ends of  justice and being an accessory to murder after the fact. It is alleged that he helped her to remove blood spatters from her body in his shower, washing the blood stains from the car and arranging for it to be towed away to hide it. Nzimande and Solomon have pleaded not guilty. Nzimande denied the hit-and-run allegations, saying that she thought she was being hijacked and saw something crashing on to her windscreen. She continued driving to Solomon’s house where she was to have dinner. A pathologist’s report concluded that Mbatha’s death was due to blood loss and that he did not get assistance on time. A witness, Jonathan Aschmann, testified that he saw a woman in a blue Polo driving with the body of a black male on the roof, while the woman was on her cellphone. Solomon told the court yesterday that Nzimande did not tell him that her car was involved in an incident that left a person dead. He did not inspect the car for damages and said Nzimande had told him that she was being hijacked and must have hit something. Daily News
