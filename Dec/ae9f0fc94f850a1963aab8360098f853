This is according to Paul Makube, senior agricultural economist at FNB Business, who said yesterday that the impact of bird flu on South Africa’s consumer was likely to see egg prices increase in the range of 15% to 20% in the next few months.  “The increase in egg prices is subject to demand and supply dynamics, with the influenza outbreak having a major influence on the recent spike,” Makube said. “The impact on prices has been more pronounced in the Western Cape due to the culling of layer hens and the subsequent supply shortages on the region’s shelves.” - African News Agency
