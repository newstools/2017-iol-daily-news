Durban - A 33-year old man, on the run for allegedly killing his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend last month, made his first appearance in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday.  Khulekani Msimang was arrested in Mpumalanga. He is believed to have fled after the attack.  
Captain Nqobile Gwala, police spokesperson, said the deceased, Sthembiso Msomi (30) and the woman had gone to a party in Nazareth, Pinetown on November 25. “After the party, the woman and Msomi went to the woman’s house and had fallen asleep. Msimang entered the house and saw Msomi and the two men got into an argument. Msimang assaulted Msomi. Msomi was rushed to hospital where he died a few days later,” Gwala said. 
Msimang was located and arrested on December 8. Gwala said he appeared in court and was remanded in police custody pending his formal bail application next week. Msimang's court appearance comes just days after a Phoenix man killed his ex-girlfriend, shot her mother and then turned the gun on himself. The couple, Shiraz Ismail and Christine Pillay, had ended a relationship four years ago, but Ismail was said to be still obsessed with her.  Pillay was expected to get married on December 30 to a police constable.
