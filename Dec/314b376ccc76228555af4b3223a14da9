The officers, from the Pietermaritzburg SAPS Public Order Policing Unit went to a house in Msinga after receiving a tip-off about a possible criminal.  Moses Dlamini, Independent Policing Investigative Directorate spokesperson, said the officers were told that Sbuyiselo Bhekza Zulu, 33, had a firearm in his possession.  “Warrant Officer Saziso James Mthalane, 48, Constable Samuel Thembinkosi Nkosi, 38, Constable Mlungisi Phiwayinkosi Sithole, 30, and members of their team went to Zulu’s house at around 11.30pm in July and ordered his father to leave.  “The elderly man walked out and the officers allegedly tortured Zulu to death. The officers then allegedly took his body and dumped it in Mphelankani, a distance from his home,” Dlamini said.  The officers are then believed to have gone to a nearby ambulance base where they told the officials they had discovered a body while out patrolling.  “The deceased man’s family had followed the officers. They managed to get the registration details of the police officers’ vehicle,” Dlamini said.  The men were remanded until January.
