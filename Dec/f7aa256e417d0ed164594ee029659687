Ncumisa Mafunda, department spokesperson, said staff had reported for work, and post-mortems were under way. Workers reportedly went on an unprotected strike for almost two weeks. It was alleged they were unhappy with their working conditions. Families lined up outside the state facility in the hopes of identifying loved ones and arranging funerals. The Daily News had spoken to a Chatsworth woman who was waiting for her husband’s body. The 28-year old man died on Sunday after an accident in Pietermaritzburg where he was attending a bikers' event. The woman said she was informed that post-mortems were continuing and she was waiting to hear when her husband’s body could be brought back to Durban. Mortuaries across the province have been crippled by staff protests since the beginning of the year. Mortuary workers have demanded that Health MEC DrSibongiseni Dhlomo address them directly. In June, staff at the Pinetown facility went on strike after disputes with management. Staff claimed they had to buy their own boots. Some said they had to request gloves daily and reuse face masks. In March, Dhlomo conducted post-mortems at the Park Rynie Mortuary, on the South Coast, after staff failed to arrive for work. Robert Simons, of the Medical Human Rights Network, said medical professionals were responsible for the integrity of bodies in their charge. “These terms are well defined in the UN Human Rights instruments and in the codes of conduct of national and international medical and nursing associations. "It is known that uncertainty in this respect may lead to traumatic disorders among the loved ones. Coping for them can only start after certainty and some kind of decent ritual,” Simons said.
