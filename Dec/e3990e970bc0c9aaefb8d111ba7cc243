Durban - Struggle hero, Laloo Chiba, has died. The 87-year old died at home a few days after he suffered a mild heart attack and was hospitalised. According to Zaakirah Vadi, Communications Officer at the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Chiba was discharged this week and passed away at his home in Lenasia.  “Chiba was a former Umkhonto we Sizwe platoon commander and was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment on Robben Island in the Little Rivonia Trial. He was jailed in B-Section, alongside Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada and others,” Vadi said. Chiba considered Kathrada his best friend and political mentor and was devastated after Kathrada passed away in March this year.  He was also deeply grieved at the recent passing of fellow Robben Island prisoner, Eddie Daniels, whom he had visited just a few weeks ago in the Western Cape.  Chiba is survived by his wife Luxmi, and his three daughters and grandchildren.  Details of his funeral have yet to be released. Daily News
