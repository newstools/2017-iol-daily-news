Basheer Bux, 67, was shot by stray pellets while driving home from mosque on Wednesday night. He felt a stinging sensation on his head. His car window was partially open at the time. Speaking from his hospital bed at the Ahmed Al-Kadi Private Hospital yesterday, Bux said: “I felt this sting and then the pain in my head. I stopped the car. I felt like I was wet on the back of my head and neck. I rubbed the area and saw the blood.” Bux saw two men walk down a house driveway and he asked them if they had thrown something towards his car. The men denied doing so. Bux drove to his house, two properties down. His family took him to hospital. “X-rays revealed that two pellets were lodged in my head just above the skull, one-and-a-half centimetres below the skin. Doctors said I was lucky it did not hit the skull. I am in a lot of pain, but will pull through,” Bux said. Police are investigating.  Shooting people, cats or dogs with airgun pellets could land you in jail, says a statement on The Airgun Shop website. Jacques Farmer, The Airgun Shop spokesperson, said a very high-powered gun could have been used because the weight of two pellets together would have slowed the projectiles down quite a bit. “A low-power rifle won’t be able to do that damage with two pellets. It could have been a close-up shot,” he said. Farmer urged users to follow safe gun-handling practices because airguns could be dangerous and were not intended for sale to minors or to be used by minors except under strict adult supervision. According to the Firearms Control Act, an airgun owner can be prosecuted if they used it to commit crimes, pointed it at any person, discharged it in a built-up area or any public place, fired shots at a person, used it to injure a person, to damage property, to abuse animals, or handled any of these guns while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
