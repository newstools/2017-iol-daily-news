Durban - The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a heavy rainfall warning for KwaZulu-Natal. According to SAWS, parts of uMgungundlovu, Harry Gwala, Ugu and eThekwini are experiencing heavy rainfall which may lead to localised flooding. Heavy rains are expected to fall between 3pm to 11pm. Moreover, according to SAWS, the weather warning is an alert of a severe weather hazard that could lead to disastrous conditions. At midday, Durban experienced a rain shower which was accompanied by a thunderstorm. Wiseman Dlamini, SAWS weather forecaster said the province is experiencing two weather systems which have resulted in a band of showers - surface trough and upper air trough - when the height contours bend to the south. “From tonight, areas around Durban can expect a 60% chance of showers and thunderstorms,” said Dlamini. “The same is also expected for Tuesday.” Dlamini said it looks like it will rain for the rest of the week, especially in the evenings. The Hollywoodbets Dolphins could also start their Momentum One-Day Cup competition on Thursday with a similar fate as the Ram Slam where most of the matches were abandoned due to rain. Daily News
