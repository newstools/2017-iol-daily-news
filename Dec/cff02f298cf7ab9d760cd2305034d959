Police are still investigating if they were buried alive or had died of their wounds before being buried in bushes alongside a farm near the M4 north in Desainagar on Monday. Zakhele Ndlovu, 48, a resident, alerted the police when he saw blood stains on the pathway between Park Avenue and the M4 north, which led him to a heap of sand. The bodies were identified as Nelisiwe Ntuli, 23, and her 6-year-old daughter, Snothile Ntuli. They were both from Maphumulo near KwaDukuza.

At first, Ntuli did not believe it, but reality set in when he had to identify their bodies at the mortuary. Ntuli said Nelisiwe had been staying with her boyfriend in an informal settlement at La Mercy while she sought employment. She had fetched Snothile from the family home at the weekend and was going to return home on Sunday after spending time together. The couple also had two boys. The boys are with their father. It is alleged Nelisiwe’s boyfriend had an argument with her and she left the informal settlement with Snothile on Monday. Police are still searching for the boyfriend, who is believed to have sold his shack and fled. “I have never seen something like this before. We were both trying to find permanent employment. My daughter was happy when she left the home,” Ntuli said. “I lost my loved ones. It is an absolute heartache,” he said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was being investigated by the oThongathi police.
