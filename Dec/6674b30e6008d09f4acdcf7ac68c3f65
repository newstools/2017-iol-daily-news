Ivor Aylward, who represents Bluff Alliance, said the storm in October had caused a portion of Tara Road to wash away, leaving a massive sinkhole and exposing underground cables that are normally covered by the pavement.  The soil from under the road surface had washed out into the Bluff Golf Course and streams.  Tara Road, which runs between Beacon Road and Club Drive, was closed by the eThekwini Municipality in October.  Residents are using an alternative route through the suburb.  Aylward inspected the crevice and found evidence that the fibre optics and high-tension cables were being stripped, possibly by scrap collectors. “The metal core around the cable seemed to have been cut by an angle grinder. They heated the lead around the cable.  “It is just a matter of time before they cut off and steal these cables.  “The repercussions would be huge. We are trying to avert a disaster.  “It has been 80 days since the road was damaged. There is no sign of repair work being undertaken,” Aylward said.  Bluff resident Aurora Marais suggested that the municipality deploy a security guard at the site.  “If their excuse is going to be that they can’t afford a guard, will our residents be compensated for the losses we incur when the power supply is interrupted?” she asked.  Ward councillor Jean Prinsloo said  he was told in October that the road had been placed on the city’s emergency repair list for urgent attention.   Andy Rossell, another Bluff resident, said there did not appear to be any urgency from the roads department to attend to the matter, despite Tara Road being one of the main arterial roads on the Bluff.  Tozi Mthethwa, the city’s spokesperson, said the matter was being investigated by the municipality’s electricity department, which had received a complaint of alleged cable theft on Tuesday.  “The department is ascertaining whether these are Telkom or electricity cables.The roads department will rehabilitate that portion of the road soon,” she said.
