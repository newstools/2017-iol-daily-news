Durban -  A police multidisciplinary sting netted in six criminals and a firearms cache in the province on Thursday. The efforts are part of clean up operations during the festive season. 
 
Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said officers arrested three men, aged between 32 and 36 in Eshowe. 
 
“The team was following up information at Thintumkhaba area about suspects involved in a business robbery that took place at Umlalazi area in Eshowe on December 4. During the attack, the victim managed to escape and lock himself at the business premises. The suspects robbed the patrons of their belongings before fleeing the scene on foot. They will appear in court next week,” Zwane said.    
Two more men, aged 31 and 32, were nabbed in Dokodweni in Gingindlovu, for being in possession of two unlicensed firearms and ammunition. 
 
“A 31-year-old suspect was also arrested for possession of drugs at Obanjeni area, Mthunzini. He was found in possession of 56 pockets of loose dagga and mandrax. Other three unlicensed firearms were also recovered by the police during the operation,” Zwane said. 
 
The firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used in any commission of the crime in the country.  Daily News
