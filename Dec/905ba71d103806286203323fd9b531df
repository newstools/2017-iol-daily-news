Durban - Zandile Gumede, mayor of the eThekwini Municipality said at an Executive Committee on Monday that a team of senior management from the Mayoral Parlour and Durban Solid Waste will work with supervisors from service departments responsible for keeping the city clean. Gumede said that it will be done to ensure things like grass cutting, tree removal and the picking up of litter will be done at a faster pace. Gumede said she tasked senior management from Durban Solid Waste to work with Acting Head of the Mayoral Parlour Martin Xaba to deal with cleanliness in the city. “Firstly, since the storms experienced in the city there have been a number of tree stumps that need to be removed but no one is taking responsibility for it. This team will also monitor the serious issue of grass cutting and other issues around cleanliness in the city,” said Gumede.  “We cannot celebrate Christmas in a dirty city. So this team, from my office, will be coordinating with supervisors responsible for the cleaning and maintaining of our city to ensure that people are working. We want to see the grass cut and litter being picked up,” continued Gumede. The mayor said that cleaning up the city and ensuring that there is basic service delivery was in her manifesto when she took office and aims to deliver on those promises. “I want it to be done now. I will deliver on my promise to residents to get the city clean,” she said. Gumede took the opportunity to thank Sipho Nzuza, the city manager and his team for their hard work in cleaning up the city. “You have been cracking your whip and I can see a difference. I drive around the city and I have already seen improvements in some areas where there were issues. While there has been a lot of focus on the inner city we must also focus on the outer lying areas such as Phoenix where grass cutting is an issue as well as rural areas within our ward,” said Gumede.
