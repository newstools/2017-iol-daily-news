Although the government has made strides in providing housing, vulnerable people who require special-needs housing struggle to access state assistance or facilities, said George Mari, provincial DA spokesperson on human settlements. Mari was reacting to the South African Human Rights Commission's criticism of the Human Settlements Department over the Life Esidimeni tragedy, in which 143 psychiatric patients died, and for failing to provide adequate housing for people with special needs. The Department of Human Settlements in KwaZulu-Natal has four facilities providing care for  those with special needs, said spokesperson Mbulelo Baloyi. These are Groutville Orphanage Home; Lungisisa Indlela Village near Osindisweni, which caters for HIV/Aids orphans; a newly constructed facility for the elderly in Durban; and an old-age home, also in Durban. Baloyi said the department could not comment on the state of these facilities as it did not get involved beyond the subsidy provisioning and construction. “These facilities are managed or administered either by NGOs or municipalities in which they are situated,” he said. In addition to the facilities, Baloyi said the department had a policy that all housing projects cater for special needs such as disabled beneficiaries, orphans, women, and child-headed households. “The specifications and house plans for special-needs beneficiaries usually differ from the normal 40 square metre housing units. A house for beneficiaries living with disabilities is 50m2, the bathroom is larger, and an access ramp is constructed.” Mari said the department’s budget made it difficult to provide adequate housing for people with special needs. "Organisations willing to help are battling to put up these facilities due to a shortage of land, as such facilities are not prioritised by municipalities who provide the land,” he said, adding that backlogs were an added problem.
