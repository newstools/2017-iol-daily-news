Durban - The N3 north and southbound lanes along Van Reenen’s Pass have been re-opened to traffic following two separate crashes and a diesel spill along the busy stretch of road in the early hours of Friday morning.  The crashes claimed the lives of three people, including a 6-month old baby. At this stage, the number of injuries have not been confirmed. In the first crash, two people were killed when three trucks, three minibus taxis and a car collided near the Caltex petrol station. In the second crash, at least two kilometres from the first scene, one person was killed after two trucks collided.  “Motorists are advised that the current traffic backlog will take a while to clear. Congested traffic, due to the backlog, may cause further delays between Harrismith in the Free State and Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal,” Roux said.  
Roux said they wished to express their  gratitude towards emergency services and rescue teams who have pulled out all the stops to speed up the recovery and mop-up operations.  “They did a sterling job in the shortest possible time,” Roux said. 
High traffic volumes are expected along the N3 Toll Route throughout this weekend as holiday makers head towards KwaZulu-Natal.
