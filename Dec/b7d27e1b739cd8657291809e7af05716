Durban - Despite weeks of heavy downpours in eThekwini, some dam levels are still critically low. This is according to Tozi Mthethwa, city spokesperson. Mthethwa said the rains were insufficient to end the drought.  “The current drought situation has worsened resulting in the level of Albert Falls Dam dropping further to 19.31 percent,” she said.  The current demand of water from this system is exceeding the supply. Residents are urged to reduce the water demand by 15 percent. Various outer lying reservoirs are being shut at night to build up storage for the following day to meet the targeted savings.  “Mostly affected areas are those which are supplied by the Durban heights system which includes areas in the North, South, Central and Western regions. eThekwini Municipality further urges holiday resorts and holiday makers to use water sparingly,” Mthethwa said. The city’s water helpline will operate 24 /7 for the duration of the festive season.  Contact the Call Centre on 0801313013, or send a WhatsApp message to 073 148 3477 to report any water-related matters. Staff will respond quickly to address the situation.
