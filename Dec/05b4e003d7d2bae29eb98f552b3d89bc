Despite the gloomy weather, Durbanites are gearing up for a bustling festive season. While many are scurrying out adding last-minute items to their shopping lists, the Daily News drove around the city searching for nativity scenes. We stumbled across three in Westville - outside the Westville Civic Centre; one at Bluff at Eco Park and inside the newly refurbished Hyper-by-the-Sea. Each year, nativity scenes are set up across the city to remind residents to take in the Christmas cheer. Speaking to the Daily News, Gail Bradford, chairperson of Durban West Tourism, said they believed the nativity scene was placed at a critical intersection in Westville and is aimed at reminding people about the true meaning of Christmas. “The feature has been a regular in Westville for the last 12 years but for two years did not feature because the items used for the nativity scene needed to be taken care of. “We were approached for sponsorship by a resident who puts the project together, and were only too happy to hop on board,” Bradfield said.
