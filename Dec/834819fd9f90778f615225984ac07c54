Captain Amon Zungu was travelling on the R603 between Folweni and Umbumbulu when his attackers drove up alongside his car and struck.  Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a car with four occupants was seen following Zungu on his way to work.  “The suspects opened fire on the police officer resulting in him being fatally wounded. They fled the scene without taking anything from the policeman’s car,” he said. A case of murder was opened at the Umbumbulu police station.  Zungu’s death comes just weeks after another police officer was killed during an ambush in the Maqhogo area, near Eshowe. Constable Jabulani Mavundla and his partner were on their way to attend to a report of a robbery at the time. “On their way back to the station, a group of men opened fire on their vehicle. Mavundla was shot,” Zwane said. “The vehicle veered out of control and crashed into a tree. Mavundla died at the scene, while his partner was taken to hospital. The suspects made off with Mavundla’s service pistol. Four men have since been arrested,” he said. “Two of the men have also been arrested previously for business robbery. All four men have abandoned their bail bid and were remanded in police custody pending their next court appearance.  “Two days earlier, two police officers were wounded in a shoot-out,” Zwane said. He said the officers were conducting crime prevention duties when they came under fire from seven men seated inside a vehicle in Inanda. The officers are still recovering from their injuries.  In October, Sergeant Nonhlanhla Masondo, 39, was killed in an armed robbery while waiting at a bus stop in Bonela. Masondo was stationed at the Maydon Wharf police station.  Her attackers grabbed her service pistol before shooting her in the chest and neck. A man has been arrested for Masondo’s murder. Daily News
