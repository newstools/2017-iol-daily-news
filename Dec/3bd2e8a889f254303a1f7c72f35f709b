Durban - Families have been lining up outside the Fort Napier State Mortuary in the hope of finding out when they will be able to continue with burial arrangements for loved ones. This is after staff at the mortuary went on strike.  
Dr Imraan Keeka, Democratic Alliance spokesperson on health, claimed that bodies have been queued for post mortems. Keeka has called on Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, KZN Health MEC to step in and take action.  
Staff is believed to have embarked on an unprotected strike since last week Monday. They are reportedly unhappy with the conditions that they have to work under. According to a source, the staff are demanding that the MEC address them.  
“Grieving families have spoken to the DA on the basis of anonymity and made clear their anger at the MEC and his department but more importantly how they are suffering while waiting to find closure especially during this time of the year,” Keeka said.  
An official at the Department of Health said they are awaiting feedback from management at the mortuary on where and when the bodies will be moved so the necessary autopsies can continue.  Daily News
