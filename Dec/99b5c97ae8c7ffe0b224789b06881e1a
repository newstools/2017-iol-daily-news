Durban - Three men, accused of killing and eating a 25-year old woman, will find out tomorrow if they will be granted bail. Nino Mbatha, Lungisani Magubane and Khayelihle Lamula are believed to have murdered Zandile Hlatshwayo in August this year.  A fourth accused, Sithembiso Sithole had abandoned his bail application during one of the men's previous court appearances. Initially seven men were arrested, however charges against three of the accused were withdrawn. In August, Mbatha, a traditional healer, went to the Estcourt Police Community Service Centre where he told police he was tired of eating human flesh. Mbatha had a body part in his hand. Police were led to a house in the Estcourt area of Rensburgdrift, where they found more body parts. It is alleged that the men lured Hlatshwayo to an area in Estcourt where she was murdered. The men allegedly dismembered her and then ate her body parts. During the investigation, Hlatshwayo’s family had come forward claiming that the body parts found at a house in Estcourt at the weekend, belonged to their relative. After DNA samples were taken and tested, it was determined that the body in fact belonged to Hlatshwayo. She was reportedly on her way to visit her sick grandmother in Pietermaritzburg when she was killed. Daily News
