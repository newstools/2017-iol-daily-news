Fifteen businesses using Pascoe Road in Mobeni said the road was in dire need of rehabilitation. Speaking on behalf of these businesses, Yaniv Ramdass, Mall Tiles Distribution property manager, said it was directly affecting their businesses. During heavy storms, there is also insufficient drainage, which made it impossible for motor vehicles to pass, as the water level was knee-high, he added. Ramdass said huge potholes had developed on the road surface, and their plight has fallen on deaf ears despite numerous e-mails being sent to the roads department. “We host a number of prominent business people who seek investment opportunities in South Africa. The state of the road is an eyesore and is truly disgraceful and embarrassing, to say the least. This is unacceptable and exceptionally dangerous,” Ramdass complained. “The Roads Department needs to comprehend that the characteristics of the area have transformed over the years, and the constant flow of heavy-duty vehicles had resulted in its current decrepit state.” In Clairwood, residents and businesses in Horseshoe Road have had similar complaints about the poor state of the road. Ward 32 councillor Sharmaine Sewshanker said the Clairwood area was in a shocking state. “The entire road needs to be resurfaced. For many years the residents have made numerous requests to the municipality and their various departments, but nothing has been done. After inclement weather, the municipality temporarily levels the road and fills sand on the surface. But it is not the solution to the problem,” Sewshanker said. Tozi Mthethwa, the eThekwini Municipality’s spokesperson, said the matter had been referred to the relevant unit for investigation. “The outcome of the investigation will determine the action to be taken,” she said.
