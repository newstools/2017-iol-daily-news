“For many companies the first target when the economy is not doing well becomes the workers," said Cosatu provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize.  "The point we wanted to emphasise to the Department of Labour is that employers must not be allowed to dodge paying bonuses to workers. “When the economy is hard hit, it’s the workers who end up suffering, particularly now that the festive season is upon us. We are warning employers not to use the economy as an excuse not to pay workers their bonuses,” Mkhize said. The festive season was often the only period when workers could spend quality time with their families. Bonuses would help workers to budget for their children for the new year, he said. “The year has not only been difficult for businesses, it has also been difficult for workers. We urge employers not to use not paying bonuses as a cost-cutting measure,” Mkhize said. Cosatu also called for an amendment to the Labour Relations Act to penalise employers in the private sector who retrench employees as  an urgent measure to curb growing levels of job losses. A picket demonstration planned by the labour federation for Thursday outside the Department of Labour in Durban did not go ahead after the department requested more time to respond to Cosatu’s demands. However, as part of the demands set to be handed to the department, Mkhize called for government vacancies, including those in municipalities, to be filled to make a difference in people’s lives. “The private sector also has a responsibility to take issues of job creation very seriously. As Cosatu we also took a decision that retrenchments must come at a cost to employers. “Retrenchments shouldn’t be easy, therefore Section 189 in the Labour Relations Act must be amended,” Mkhize said.
