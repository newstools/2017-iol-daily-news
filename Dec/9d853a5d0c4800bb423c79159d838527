Msizi Mkhize was knocked down by a car while walking home with a friend. The Daily News reported at the time that Health Department paramedics had declared him dead and had taken him to the Phoenix morgue where he had spent the evening in the fridge. When the family arrived the next day to identify him and sign the required documentation, a mortuary employee discovered the 28-year-old was still alive. He was rushed to the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, where he died about five hours later. Last week, his father, Peter Mkhize, said they could not get a copy of the autopsy without a lawyer’s letter. “We are currently being assisted by Mary de Haas, from the KZN Violence Monitor. We hope that the private person will interpret the medical records and the autopsy report submitted by the state pathologist,” Mkhize said. De Haas said they sourced the private pathologist through the Medical Rights Advocacy Network. “The release of the report to the family depends on the investigator. I have put the family in touch with a good private pathologist. We were worried about the fact that the man was declared dead by state paramedics and that the family was battling to get the autopsy result that could explain the cause of his death,” De Haas said. She said the pathologist would start working on the case once she found an opportunity. Daily News
