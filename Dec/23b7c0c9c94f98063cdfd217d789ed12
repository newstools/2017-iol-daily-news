The Phoenix resident died in his home on Sunday. He was one of the founding members of the band together with his father, Valla Kitsen, 70, from whom he learnt his craft. His brother, Marlin Kisten, said the death had left a void in the family. Kisten was diagnosed with cancer in April. “He put up a brave fight and was determined to beat it. But in the past week, his health took a turn for the worst," Valla said. The night before, close family members gathered around his bedside. “He wanted us to play some golden oldies and devotional songs for him,” he said. The singer was described by the family as a multi-talented keyboard player who also gave musical lessons at the Rama Krishna Centre in Phoenix. He leaves behind his two brothers, a sister, his wife Elaine and two daughters aged 7 and 5. The funeral will take place at the Shri Marriammen Temple Hall in Phoenix on Monday. Daily News
