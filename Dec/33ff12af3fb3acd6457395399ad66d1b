The organisations include the Active Citizens Movement, the Right2Know campaign and the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance. The protest will take place on Wednesday outside the ICC where the city's councillors were expected to converge for the last full council meeting of the year. Phezukonke Mthethwa, the provincial leader of the Right2Know campaign, said the proposed amendment would affect civil society and the media.  Mthethwa said the implication of the amendment was that whatever requests they made to the municipality could be rejected and this would stifle the free-flow of information.  A lack of consultation with civil society was also a problem, he said. “They have only consulted with sweetheart civil society.”  Although he would not give names, Mthethwa said some of these organisations were dependent on the municipality for funding. This put them in a position where they could not speak out against their funders, he said. Ben Madokwe of the Active Citizens Movement said: “We are very disappointed with the city. They are giving us laws that are not taking us anywhere. It is a distraction from the real issues.” Madokwe, the chairperson of the organisation, said the bill only served to stop transparency and make it harder to call officials to account. He said the Secrecy Bill was stopped nationally and they did not want to have a version of it at the eThekwini level. He said they would hold a placard protest outside the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre tomorrow and invited the public to join in at 9am. Tozi Mthethwa, city communications head, said the municipality had not approved the amendments as they were still to be discussed. Daily News
