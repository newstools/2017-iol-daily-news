Durban - Two youngsters drowned during an afternoon swim in Oakford, Verulam, on Sunday afternoon.  Prem Balram of Reaction Unit SA, said a passerby noticed the children's clothing lying on the river bank but there were no sign of the two boys. "We received a call at about 4:30pm after residents failed to locate the boys. When we arrived at the scene, the families of both the boys said the two had not returned home. Officers from SAPS Search and Rescue and Umhlali K9 unit arrived and conducted a sweep of the river," he said. Balram said the dog managed to locate the bodies and police divers entered the water. They retrieved both the bodies from the river.  "Paramedics assess the children and found that they showed no signs of life," he said. Residents claimed that the river is usually shallow however due to recent rains, the water levels have increased drastically. The boys were aged 10 and 11. Daily News
