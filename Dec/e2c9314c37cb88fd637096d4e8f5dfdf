Durban - The  National Council of SPCAs is set to lay charges against a KwaZulu-Natal deputy mayor after a video showing the brutal killing of a dog, chained to a fence, went viral last week. Vonny Strachan, National Senior Inspector at the NSPCA, confirmed that they will be taking action against those in the video. "At this stage, the matter is under investigation. Once completed, we will lay the necessary charges," Strachan said. The 1m 39s video shows a man shooting the dog with a high-powered rifle. The dog tries to dodge out of the way and the man is seen walking up to the animal and shooting it at close range. After a few seconds, the dog is seen slumping to the ground. One of the men in the video is believed to be Philani Ntombela, Mthonjaneni deputy mayor. He is seen cheering on the shooter. It is alleged that the dog had been killing livestock in the area. According to reports, Mthonjaneni claimed that the owner of the dog gave them permission to kill it. Mthonjaneni further alleges that the owner was present during the shooting. Hundreds of social media users have called the shooting a "despicable act". Daily News
