ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said space limitations meant they were only able to accredit 1000 journalists. “Those accredited include technical staff from three broadcasters who will carry all the news programmes from the conference venue,” he said. Kodwa said registration for the conference and collection of accreditation is expected to take place at Nasrec Metro Rail Station from today to Friday between 9am and 6pm. Media representatives from all over the world are expected to converge at the expo centre on Saturday for the beginning of the five-day event. Kodwa declined to divulge how many foreign journalists have applied for the event, but confirmed that the number of journalists includes “all foreign correspondence agencies”. He said inside the conference hall, journalists would be allowed to attend the opening address by President Jacob Zuma. They would leave the hall for the closed session to 
take place. Kodwa said the media would also be allowed in during nominations for candidates to vote for leadership positions. “We will also hold regular briefings in between closed sessions by commissions rapporteurs,” he said. Kodwa said the media would also be allowed in when the new president, possibly Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, former AU Commission chairperson, or Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, delivers the closing remarks on the last day of the conference. The two are the frontrunners among seven presidential candidates. It has been reported that about 5200 voting delegates would be at the conference, which would be secured by about 450 security staff. The number of delegates includes 4720 representatives of various branches across the country. Other voting delegates would come from the ANC’s national executive committee, nine provincial executive committees and the ANC youth and women’s leagues. Daily News
