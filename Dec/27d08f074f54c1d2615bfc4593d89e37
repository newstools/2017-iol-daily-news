Durban - The National Sea Rescue Institute has issued a full moon Spring Tide warning for beachgoers. Craig Lambinon, NSRI spokesperson said the tide will peak on January 2 “From Thursday until around January 7, the full moon Spring Tide will have an affect on the coastline. High tide will be higher than normal, low tide will be lower than normal and as a result of this the Rip Currents will be stronger than normal,” he said. The public is warned to swim at beaches only where lifeguards are on duty. They are further warned to obey the safety instructions of the lifeguards and only swim within the safe swimming zones demarcated by lifeguards. “Children should have responsible adult supervision in and around water. Anglers fishing along the shoreline, particularly along rocks on the shoreline, are at greatest risk during the Spring Tide because incoming waves during the Spring high tides engulf higher than normal over rocks because of the higher than normal high tide. Anglers should not turn their back to the sea and should be vigilant and cautious of the wave action and the two high tides and two low tides daily while fishing,” Lambinon said. The Spring Tide happens at every full  moon, affecting coastal water by causing a higher or lower than normal tide. This in turn causes rip currents to be stronger than usual. Full moon Spring Tide will occur on January 2 and the next Spring Tide is the new moon Spring Tide on January  17 Daily News
