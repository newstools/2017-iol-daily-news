Durban - A man was killed and two other injured after two vehicles collided on the M4, Ruth First Highway, just passed the M41 offramp on Wednesday afternoon. It is alleged that a car crashed into the back of a delivery vehicle, causing the delivery vehicle to overturn. Kyle van Reenen, Crisis Medical spokesperson, said emergency teams arrived at the scene and found the driver of the delivery vehicle, a 58-year old man, entrapped in the wreckage. “He had sustained fatal injuries. Unfortunately there was nothing paramedics could do to assist and he was declared deceased on arrival. Two other occupants of the delivery vehicle sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate and were treated and stabilised at the scene before being transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital for further care,” he said. The driver of the car, a woman, suffered no injuries and refused pre-hospital treatment. Traffic was severely affected as part of the roadway remained closed for over an hour to allow emergency services to clear the scene. Daily News
