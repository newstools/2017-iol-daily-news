Durban - Two sisters were left injured after a Ford Ranger bakkie crashed into an outbuilding at a house in Waterloo, north of Durban, on Tuesday midday. The sisters are aged 20 and 15. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson said at 12.11pm members of Rusa were called to the scene by residents in the area. “Upon arrival it was established that the two sisters were in the outbuilding when the bakkie crashed into it. They suffered moderate injuries from debris which fell onto them. RUSA Medics treated the two for their injuries on scene before transporting them to Osindisweni Hospital,” said Balram. Balram said that according to witnesses, the bakkie belonged to someone who lived on the property but had passed away on Sunday. While funeral arrangements were being made, a family member parked the car at the top of the driveway. “While seated in the driver's seat the bakkie began to roll down the steep driveway. The 24 year old attempted to stop the vehicle without success when it crashed into the home,” said Balram. He also said the outbuilding was extensively damaged. Daily News
