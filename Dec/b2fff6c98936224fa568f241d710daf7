Durban - Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court Mogoeng Mogoeng called for the private sector to be under as much scrutiny as the public sector. He said this at the University of KwaZulu-Natal where he was instituted as the third chancellor chancellor of the institution.The first being former parliament speaker Frene Ginwala who was followed by former KZN premier Zweli Mkhize.  “There is a lot of wrongdoing in public sector,” he said. But there was also a lot of it happening in private sector too. Mogoeng said he once told captains of industry at a business meeting that they should root out corruption within their own ranks. The collusion and wrongdoing amongst businesses unearthed by the Competition Commission was one such example he mentioned. With the recent political events happening in the country Mogoeng went to say people should be objective in their assessments of what was happening. He encouraged a person not to turn a blind eye to corrupt activities just because they liked the person. “It’s all about how best to take South Africa forward,” Mogoeng said.Another topic he covered was that of education. UKZN was one of the hotspots of the #FeesMustFall movement last year. Mogoeng said he did not have a solution on how to achieve free education but lessons could be learned from countries like Algeria who provided free education at every level from basic to tertiary.
