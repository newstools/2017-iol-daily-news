Kyle van Reenen of Crisis Medical, said five other occupants who were in the truck were also injured. “Crisis Medical and other emergency services arrived at the scene. The driver, in his 50s, was critically injured and was entrapped in the wreckage of the truck. eThekwini Fire Department had to use the Jaws of Life to extricate the man from the wreckage,” van Reenen said. The man was placed on a ventilator and rushed through to hospital. Earlier in the day, 13 people were injured in two separate crashes in Musgrave and Westville.
