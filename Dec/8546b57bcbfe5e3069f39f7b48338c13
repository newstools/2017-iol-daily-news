FNB agricultural economist Paul Makube said that this impacted positively on the interest rate outcomes.  “Following a robust agriculture output during the 2016/17 production season, South Africa is poised for another good season with recent forecasts favouring a La Niña weather pattern, which imply decent rainfall for the 2017/18 season,” said Makube.  He said it was expected that rainfall conditions over the summer rainfall area would improve towards the end of this month and early January, which is critical for the grain crops that have already been planted and for the late plantings.  “Grain prices remain range-bound with current maize spot prices still trending at low levels below R2000 a ton and R2100 a ton for white and yellow maize respectively.  “Although the July futures for both the white and yellow maize have just edged above R2000 a ton, there is limited further upside due to the bullish supply outlook given that local stocks are expected to be comfortably above 4 million tons by April 2018 and the 2017/18 production of just over 13 million tons,” said Makube. He said in the oilseed complex the rising production outlook with planted area for sunflower and soybeans up 5% and 25% respectively compared with the previous season remained a bearish feature for prices.   The above-average weather condition also favours the horticulture sector to do particularly well across the growing areas except in the Western Cape where drought conditions still persist.  Robust agricultural output is expected to continue to contribute positively to the overall economy next year.  Daily News
