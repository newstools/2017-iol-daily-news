Christy will represent South Africa alongside Sam Christianson, 19, also of Durban, and Cape Town's Alfonso Peters, 28. In May Christy, then 16, was crowned the South African Longboard Surfing champion after becoming the youngest woman surfer to win the open women’s division of the championship hosted in Durban. “When Christy was six I pushed her on to her first wave. Now she’s heading to the world champs. I’m stoked,” said proud father Grant Gilmour as his daughter and Christianson were capped with their South African colours at a 
ceremony at the Riverside Hotel recently. Christianson was selected for the national team by winning the SA Open Longboard trials at Long Beach, Cape Town, last month 
and will now be competing alongside Peters for the world title at 
Riyue Bay on China’s Hainan island - the country’s southern-most point. The International Surfing Association (ISA) has a rich history of hosting events in China as part of a strategy to expand surfing to new markets around the globe. The ISA first engaged China in 2010 which led to the hosting of the Hainan Riyue Bay International Surfing Festival in 2012. Riyue Bay, a relatively unknown surfing destination at the time, burst into the international spotlight and has since become a famed left-point break and popular destination for visiting surfers. The 2018 ISA World Longboard Championship runs from January 19 to 26. For further information, visit www.isasurf.org Daily News
