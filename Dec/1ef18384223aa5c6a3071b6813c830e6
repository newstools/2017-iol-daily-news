Durban - Four men, wanted in connection with a business robbery in Wentworth on Wednesday morning, are set to make an appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon.  The men were arrested after police conducted an extensive search through the area, minutes after the robbery.  Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said employees at the Brooklyn Road business were held up at gunpoint by the armed men.  “The suspects took cellphones and an undisclosed amount of cash from the tills. When the police arrived at the scene, the suspects had already left.
