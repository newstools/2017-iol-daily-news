Durban - Two men, involved in a cannibalism case in Estcourt, will spend Christmas behind bars. This after their bail was denied in the Estcourt Magistrate’s Court on Thursday morning. Their co-accused have since abandoned their bail application.  The matter has been postponed to January next year.  In court, the Magistrate said the Investigating Officer needed to be present in court to supply details as to how far the investigation was if a further postponement. Prosecution in the case argued that there were a lot of body parts that needed to be matched and forensic evidence could take longer.  
The men are accused of murdering Zanele Hlatshwayo and consuming her body parts in August this year. The men have been in custody since then. Three  of the men have since abandoned their bail application. 
Police were alerted to the incident after one of the men walked into a police station and said he was tired of eating human flesh. 
Police were then led to a house where more body parts were found.  Daily News
