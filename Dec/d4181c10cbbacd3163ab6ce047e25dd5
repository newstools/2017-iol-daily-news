And it is because of mayor Zandile Gumede’s vision “to inspire youth in a meaningful way”, the director of brand partnerships at Discovery Network International, Sureka Abbas, told the launch of the global media giant’s three-year partnership with Durban Tourism on Thursday. She said that when the city’s Exco representatives met the Discovery hierarchy in London to discuss the massive new marketing campaign the Discovery Channel was mounting for Durban, the mayor asked them what they could do for the youth of the city, other than marketing. That was when Discovery came up with the idea of giving an aspiring film-maker (not an experienced one) the chance to win a competition, to be launched next year.  It will be facilitated via the Durban Film Office and Durban Tourism. The winner of the Durban Film-maker of the Year contest will jet off to Discovery’s head office in London to be mentored for three days.  The winner will return home, to film Durban through his or her lens.  The film will be run on the Discovery Channel, reaching a global audience of millions, giving the winner mass exposure. Daily News
