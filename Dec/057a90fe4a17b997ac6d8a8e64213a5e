Durban - Thirty-six schoolgirls on a hiking trip to the Tugela Gorge had to be rescued after heavy rains caused rivers to swell, trapping them in the Royal Natal National Park Gorge on Thursday.
Before the rescue, the Mountain Club of South Africa (MCSA) rescue team was dispatched by road to the Royal Natal National Park where a teenage boy suffered a head injury after a fall on the Tugela Gorge trail. The MCSA teamed up with members of Ezemvelo KZN and Okhahlamba disaster management to urgently get to the boy. Gavin Raubenheimer, of Mountain Club South Africa search and rescue, said the park rangers also received a call for assistance from a group of teenagers in the same area. The heavy downpour made the rivers swell, cutting the group off from the gorge exit. “A teenage boy had suffered a head injury and clavicle fracture. We are not sure what caused him to fall. A stretcher rescue party and medics went in and treated the boy for the injuries. He was removed by stretcher and taken to an ambulance where he was transported to a hospital in Harrismith,” Raubenheimer said. The 36 teenage girls, accompanied by two teachers, had become trapped on an island alongside the swollen Tugela River. Heavy rain had been falling for many hours making the river impassable. “The rescue team were unable to cross the swollen river and bivvied (camped) for the night near the trapped party. On Thursday morning with a lower water level, ropes were set up across the river and the teenagers were brought to safety,” Raubenheimer said. The girls were treated for mild hypothermia. Daily News
