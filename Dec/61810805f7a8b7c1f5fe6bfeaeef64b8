Durban - One person has been killed while at least nine others have been left seriously injured after a multi-vehicle crash on the N2, M7 interchange on Thursday. It is believed that a truck, carrying storage containers, was travelling down the N2 southbound, when it overturned at the M7 offramp. Garrith Jamieson of Rescue Care, said the truck crushed two cars and crashed into three more. In one of the cars, the driver succumbed to his injuries while two more people had to be extricated from the wreckage using the Jaws of Life. “The M7 has been closed to traffic while clean up teams continue to clear the area,” Jamieson said. He said the injured have all been stabilised at the scene and rushed to Durban hospitals for further care. Earlier this morning, bus passengers sustained minor injuries in a crash between a bus and a truck in Shallcross, near Chatsworth. Daily News
