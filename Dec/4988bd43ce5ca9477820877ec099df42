For 10 years the Pelucci family of Dan Pienaar Drive in Moseley Park have had a Christmas light display covering every inch of their garden.  Homeowner John Pellucci said it took the family four Saturdays to put up the LED light displays. Around his home there is a Santa Claus riding a motorbike, a synchronised display of Santa and a snowman on a see-saw.  A light display streams midway up a light pole with mistletoe at the end, while the garage door has Santa swinging on a playground swing.  A brightly lit palm tree sits between the garage and main building wall. Here Santa is also on a sleigh and a snowman is in the garden.  Pellucci said he has collected a bakkie-load of food so far after placing a drum outside his home to collect food for the SPCA.  “In 2016 we gave it a break but were inundated with letters in our post box from children asking if we could continue inviting Santa to the neighbourhood. We expect at least 250 kids on Christmas Eve. I derive pleasure from looking at the kids enjoying themselves. We will have lots of entertainment on Christmas Eve,” he said.   Outside Jill and Dave Moss’s family home on Caefron Avenue, Westville, scores of onlookers were seen taking selfies near the light displays and families marvelled at the display. It included signs like “Santa stop here”, and “Merry XMAS”, and sequence lights of reindeer hopping about.  The Munsami home in Somerset Park in uMhlanga is nothing short of a spectacle. The lights and sequences include Santa on their roof entering and disappearing down a chimney.    Buff resident Tinus Botha, with help from his family, turned their front garden in Gatewick Close into a Christmas Wonderland for all to enjoy.   Botha said his garden was open through December for young and old to visit.  Daily News
