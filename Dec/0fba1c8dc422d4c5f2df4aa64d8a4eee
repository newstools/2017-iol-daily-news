A 10th plate was removed from the front of the plinth, as well as four brass cappings that formed part of a dome. Police arrested one suspect at the Cenotaph and then raided a scrap collector in the Point area, finding strips of copper taken from the plaques. Police searched a business premises on Mathews Meyiwa (Stamford Hill) Road in Greyville and arrested a scrap dealer.
