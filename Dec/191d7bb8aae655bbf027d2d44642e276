Durban - Yesterday's wet weather did little to dampen the mood at Moses Mabhida Stadium, where the inaugural Metro Police Open Day was held. Thousands took to the stands as the various policing units displayed their routines. 
Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, metro police spokesperson, said the event was the first of its kind for the metro force. He said it would become an annual event on the Durban calendar. Commissioner Steve Middleton, acting head of metro police, said the day was an overall success. “We had more than 5000 people who attended the event, and that was incredible. The band, the demonstrations and the drill squad were all fantastic,” he said. Middleton said the drawcards of the event were the dog handlers and their four-legged partners who took part in demonstrations. “The teams conducted an exhi- bition of a hijacking and how they would respond with their dogs. Indirectly, this was a very good bonding exercise for the officers. I gave an instruction that we would be working with skeleton staff, so members were invited to come and share in the day. This created a sense of camaraderie among officers, something that has not been felt within the metro police for a long time. We hope to carry this out in the future, on a smaller scale,” he said. Middleton commended the officers who prepared for the event. “We thank both the mayor and city manager for allowing us to host the event,” Middleton said. Daily News
