But most customers exchanged their gifts for the correct size or something of the same value, like Brett Milton of Montclair, who had bought his dad, Larry, shirts at Woolworths at Gateway, but was exchanging them at Galleria Mall branch in eManzimtoti on Tuesday. “He loved what I bought him, but I got the size wrong,” he said. There was a heap of returned clothes behind the counter along the corridor at Truworths, with sales assistant Nompilo Zinya saying there had been more in previous years. Some people wanted refunds, while others had exchanged their gifts for something else and all were exercising customers’ rights, which enabled them to return clothing within 30 days as long as they had proof of payment and the items had not been worn, she said. By mid-afternoon, only a “couple” of customers had returned gifts at Mr Price Home store in Galleria, said assistant manager Sifiso Mhlanga. More than 1000 Galleria shoppers -like those at other centres - made sure their gifts were never returned. They had given gift cards, enabling their friends and relatives to choose their own presents. And some were lucky enough to get R5000 cards. “We sold about two R5 000 vouchers every day for 12 days,” said information kiosk assistants Precious Mkhize and Zinhle Mleti. Daily News
