 Durban - Four people were killed and 12 others injured when a minibus taxi and a bus collided on Tweedie Main Road in Howick on Thursday morning. Ineke van Huyssteen, ER24 spokesperson, said four patients were entrapped in the front of the taxi, while three more were seated in the back of the taxi.  “Some patients were already being treated in the ambulances. Four people were declared dead at the scene and 12 others sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious,” van Huyssteen said.  ER24, as well as other medical services on the scene, transported the patients to hospital for further medical care. In another incident, a 27-year old man was seriously injured after his hand got caught in a conveyor belt at an industrial site in Prospecton in Durban. According to van Huyyssten, the man’s colleagues managed to help him free his left hand.  “He was treated at the scene and stabilised before being rushed to a nearby hospital,” van Huyyssten said.
