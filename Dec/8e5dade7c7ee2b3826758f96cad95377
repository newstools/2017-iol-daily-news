Durban - A 16-year-old mother has had her newborn baby girl stolen from her by a woman she met on the taxi from the hospital. 
Now, after a case of child stealing was opened, members of the Durban Central Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit are appealing to the public for help in tracking down the suspect. The drama unfolded at 15.45pm on November 20, when the new mother was at the Williams Road, Chesterville, taxi rank with her baby daughter. “She was approached by a woman who she met at the taxi from hospital to town. The woman offered to assist her with the baby while she went to the ladies’ room,” said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. “The mother then left the child with the unknown woman. She came out of the ladies’ room only to find that the woman and the baby were nowhere to be found, only the bag which was left on the floor.” Although she made enquiries from people in the vicinity, there was no sign of the baby. The mother does not have any photos of the infant. The police believe the woman in the attached identikit can help solve the case. Anyone with information of her whereabouts is asked to contact Detective-Sergeant M E Mkhize on 031 325 4526 /082 466 0044 or the Crime Stop number 08600 10111. Daily News
